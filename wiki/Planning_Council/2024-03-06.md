### Discussions

#### Funded dev efforts - specifically community engineer (aka onboarding mentor) - [gitlab #19](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/19)
- A decision on this is expected from Steering Committee in the coming weeks

#### New timing of meeting to accommodate Manoj (welcome for Manoj will be next meeting because he isn't available this week)
- Maybe able to move 1 1/2 hours earlier. Doodle poll [sent out](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse.org-planning-council/msg03708.html).

#### Jonah out of office 11-22 March
- Ed has kindly agreed to do the last few steps of EPP release process.
  See [endgame issue](https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/issues/127) for details.

#### Status of 2024-03 (and early planning on -06)
- All reports are positive
- Discussion on macOS issue with mac SDK version.
  This is not under consideration for a respin even if it is fixed in time because the workaround is simple (uses different JDK version) and primarily only affects eclipse developers.
  See [SWT issue #1012](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/1012) for details.
- Discussion on Java 21 upgrade.
  The EPP and SimRel decision are made already and [announced](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg19843.html), but the discussion focussed instead on if/when Platform should change BREE to Java 21.
  See [Issue #188](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/.github/discussions/188) for ongoing discussions.
