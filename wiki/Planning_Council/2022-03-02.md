## Notes

  - The actions for the last meeting have all been completed - see the
    last meeting notes for details
    [2022-02-02](2022-02-02.md)
  - 2022-03 status update:
      - The log4j 1.2.15 is probably not going to be in the 2022-03
        SimRel repository.
      - **Action (Jonah)** to confirm the above and make changes if
        possible to resolve it.
  - The 2022-09 and 2022-12 schedules need to be created. Following
    discussion the same schedule as 2021-09 and 2021-12 will be used
    (which means 1 week less for 2022-12 and one extra week for 2023-03
    to keep 2022-12 release away from Christmas break)
      - **Action (Jonah)** Update planning calendars and wikis
  - Membership of planning council discussed.
      - Need to review membership and make sure that all Top Level
        projects that contain projects part of the SimRel are properly
        invited to participate in the Planning Council
      - Review existing membership for discussions on existing
        participation
      - The Planning Council website needs to be updated -
        <https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/council.php>
      - **Action (Jonah)** Lead this effort in coordination with
        Wayne/Maria/EMO.
  - PGP
      - PGP update from Ed
      - 2022-06 will allow PGP signed content in SimRel (that is signed
        by PGP and not jarsigned - jarsigned content is still allowed
        and unsigned content is still not allowed)
      - Announcement to be made in the coming weeks once some
        documentation is updated
