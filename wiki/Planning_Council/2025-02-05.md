- glibc requirement
- Improving support for sponsorship (Issue: [Consider to provide an in-application view for notification/sponsorship](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/134))
- Removal of ECF from SimRel


## Follow-Up Actions

- Discuss integration of Marketplace Client into p2 (Leif)


## Minutes

### Status 2025-03

- Overall good status
- M2 was difficult for several reasons (unreliable infrastructure, marketplace client)
- Marketplace Client
  - Is inherent part of IDE, so should it still be released separately or should it be merged with p2?
  - No public API, so no issues when moving or renaming (but no need for namespace changes either; project has already been moved once)
  - Leif will discuss with developers
- Certificate store
  - Context: Some months ago, Windows trust store was set to products by default
    - No official reports about problems with this
    - But some ITs strip down trusted certificates in OS store, so they need to remove default parameters to use JVM trust store instead (as it has more root certificates per default)
    - See: [Specify VM options on Windows to use the system certificate store](https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/pull/224#issuecomment-2627576123)
  - There are ways to mix multiple trust stores (e.g., MS Edge also has an own trust store, mixing it up with the OS trust store)
  - SAP has a solution for mixing JVM and OS trust store
  - Short-term solution:
    - Keep everything as is for 2025-03 release
    - Motivation: easier to remove problematic VM arguments than requiring the addition of arguments that may not be aware of
  - Mid-term solution:
    - Implement a mechanism for mixing JVM and OS trust store
    - There have been PRs to platform in the same direction, which may be contributed in simplified parts
    - SAP has a solution for mixing trust stores and will propose it (after 2025-03 release)

### glibc Requirement
- Required glibc version was increased for GTK4
  - Required version is too high for many users
  - E.g., if you are not on latest Ubuntu, RHEL etc., restarting IDE after update to IDE with recent SWT will fail
- Critical issue to be resolved for 2025-03
- Jonah, Hannes and Christoph are currently taking care of it
- Solution will probably be provided by M3

### Sponsorship
- See: [Consider to provide an in-application view for notification/sponsorship](https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/134)
- Embedding sponsorship webpage into IDE does not look good (e.g., uses light theme even if IDE is in dark theme)
- Ed proposes solution with a webpage that can be queried with proper styling (better fitting into IDE)
- Invitation to leave comments on the mentioned issue
- Question is also about what and how often to present to users

### ECF Removal from SimRel
- PR for removing ECF from SimRel exists
    - Dependencies to ECF are rare and can easily be replaced, so removing it would have almost no impact
- General note on SimRel: in former times, SimRel wanted to collect all Eclipse contributions, but nowadays it's rather about requirements of the IDE (and of most RCP products)


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on March 5th, 2025.
