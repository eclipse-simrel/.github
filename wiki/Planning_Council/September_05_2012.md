## Announcements

  - ?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *none*

## Juno SR1

  - SR1 coming soon\! See
    [Juno/Simultaneous_Release_Plan\#Service_Releases](Juno/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Service_Releases "wikilink").
    Issues? Problems?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *One issue was mentioned at end of meeting, where Tycho? signing
    plugin? (something) changed that broke ability to sign and produce
    packed jars. \[Apologies, not sure who was speaking\]. But they said
    they'd have to research more to figure out what the issue what
    (they'd just returned from vacation) ... if issue was that "builder
    suddenly changed on them" (and they don't know how to specify a
    particular one) or if "no one is responsible for overall framework"
    (or, something like that, I'm sure I'm misquoting). If this is about
     then yes, jar processor should be fixed, but seems like possibly
    could be worked around? But, member said they'd have to look into it
    more and get back to us once they'd "caught up" from being out.*

## Kepler

### Continue and conclude annual debrief

  - [Juno_retrospective](Planning_Council/Juno_retrospective.md)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Feel free to add things to the page before the meeting, if that
    would facilitate discussion.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Mostly discussed "runtime projects" as has been being discussed on
    Rt PMC list. I noted a few things in
    [Juno_retrospective](Planning_Council/Juno_retrospective.md)
    but was thought to be an on-going discussion.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Be sure to read last years:
    [Indigo_retrospective](Planning_Council/Indigo_retrospective.md)

### Begin Kepler Requirements Planning

  - [SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Begin discussion of requirements, if changes needed. To the extent
    possible, I suggest we start with high level issues this month (such
    as, should any be added, removed?) and perhaps finish up with
    wording changes for clarification (if any) next month.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''Didn't discuss much. I brought up issue of low compliance to
    "greediness" issue, and as far as I know, to define everything in
    features is the only way for adopters to provide patches ... so ...
    either I need education, or better educate others on why important?
    Or ... maybe others don't need patches? What's alternative? New
    release? (which, adopters can not do "on their own", typically, such
    as for a "hot fix" for one customer). ''

## Other Business

  - What's status of new "Portal Interface"? (Wayne?). Is it (nearly)
    ready to use for "Simultaneous Release data"? For example, links to
    ramp down plan, accessibility support, reports? Etc.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Wayne said "release 1" is tentatively expected end of this month.
    This would replace most (basic) functionality of current portal ...
    enhancements would be added from there. To add "Simultaneous Release
    tracking" (e.g. URLs for rampdown plans, accessibility, etc.), would
    be considered, but "low on the list". Mostly focused on integrating
    plans/releases so they are all easier, whether yearly train or not,
    if I understood sentiment.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Procedure and trade-offs for explicit "sign up" for "the next"
    Simultaneous Release.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *No one seemed to think it that hard the way it was, and was useful
    to show "people still involved". Granted, more could be done with
    automation, but seemed lower on priority than other things.
    Concluded with asking PC members to comment on  if they had opinions
    or improvements.*

## Next Meeting

  - October 3, 2012 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
    Eastern).
