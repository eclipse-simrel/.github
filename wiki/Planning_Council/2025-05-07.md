## Minutes

### Status 2025-06
- SimRel M2 is scheduled for Friday, 9th May and we will not further postpone it
- Contributions are still being made (even from Platform) last minute to the general SimRel M2 contribution deadline
- Nothing else to be done regarding M2/release or the previous infrastructure issues

### SimRel Requirements
- Ed proposes simplification of SimRel requirements: https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/pull/49
  - Removes things that nobody is doing (release records, progress reviews, â€¦)
  - Outdated information (like bundles without manifests)
- Reasoning
  - SimRel should not care about that and not require that but be as simple as possible and primarily require to follow the Eclipse Development Process
  - There are better ways to provide relevant information nowadays, such as via GitHub
- Some projects still create release records (like CDT) and they may keep providing them (we only remove the formal requirement for them in SimRel requirements)
- None of the meeting participants objected to the proposed simplifications; PR will be kept open until end of 8th May and if no one objects is considered as approved by the planning council

### Funded Dev Efforts
- Community mentor contracts
  - No objections on extending those contracts with highest priority
- ECF: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/37
  - Platform has a newer HTTP client based only on JDK used by default
    - May be insufficient in specification environments
    - But no one complained about the client so far, so either it's sufficient for most users or those user have branded products still embedding the HTTP client from ECF
  - EPP uses workaround to embed older client from ECF
    - ECF client has all kinds of third-party libraries
  - Issue is still relevant (there is work to be done), but currently not in a state to be started
    - For normal users, it's hard to understand and reproduce the actual issue(s)
    - None of the planning council members oversee the work and face issues to be addressed by it
  - *Conclusion:* due to lack of knowledge and interest, change priority to "undecided"
- GTK: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/17
  - Renesas is working on GTK4 support
    - More information to be shared in Developers Community Call
    - More work to be done than can be done by Renesas
  - Biggest issue is Webkit
  - *Conclusion:* issue to be kept as the only one at "high" priority to be considered after community mentors; in case funding shall be started, actual tasks need to be clarified in coordination with work on the topic currently done by others (like Renesas)


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on June 4th, 2025.
