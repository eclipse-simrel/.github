        We should take a position on release or no release.
        Judging from items not marked, it appears these are the projects
        of worst quality (or, worst adopter readiness?):
        These should be 'resolved' one way or the other ... fixed, if
        fixed, won't fix and document why not.

        These are rough, quick dates, just taken from last year (and
        adjust to closest Friday and similar)
        Still need to go through calendar, see if adjustments needed for
        Holidays, EclipseCon, etc.
        PC Reps should start to discuss these dates with their groups,
        and see if they will commit to participating from the beginning
        ... from M1\!

## Reference

  - from previous meeting: PC Position on off-cycle releases and use of
    discovery site (and EPP)? This came up in discussions about a Pulsar
    package.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        Conclusion: we do not want to support off-cycle releases. But
        with following compromise: If a project still met all the normal
        "release criteria" set forth as must-do's by PC then they could
        introduce something new during SR1 or SR2 (that is SR1 and SR2
        can have more than service, if important, and must-do criteria
        met). The reason for not supporting things off cycle was a. it
        is more work to support it, b. there is no opportunity for
        "simultaneous release" testing, c. it would dilute the meaning
        of "simultaneous release".
