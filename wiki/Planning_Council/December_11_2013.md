## Announcements

  - Have started the "Luna+1" naming process (See ). Thanks Chris, for
    taking the initiative.

## Kepler SR2

  - ?

## Luna Planning

  - Review Policy Wording

<!-- end list -->

  -
    After our last meeting, I realized we had never incorporated "Doug's
    wording" about new features in SRs into the actual Policy FAQ
    (though we discussed and agreed, though left open a month in case
    strategic members needed to discuss internally). I have now
    incorporated the wording in the FAQ. See
    [SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Policy_FAQ](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Policy_FAQ "wikilink"),
    the note that starts "\[added April, 2013, modified November
    2013\]".

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Please review and approve to make sure I've correctly captured what
    we discussed -- and then "we" will announce on cross-project list.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Approved.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Any new requirements? Any to remove or change?

:\* Do we formally approve
[requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink") for
Luna?

  -

      -
        *Approved.*

:\* If we ask people to specify exact feature (or repository) versions
in b3 aggregator files (see ) is that a new "requirement" or
implementation detail? For some, it would require "more work" and/or
better tools to generate the files more easily. (Maybe make a
requirement for next cycle?)

  -

      -
        *No discussion. At best, we'll get some "recommendations"
        documented and have on-going discussion about how best to
        accomplish the objective.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Anyone concerned about EPP's plans to require Java 7?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    See . Don't we usually encourage (but not require) projects to
    support the same "Target Environments" as the [Eclipse Platform
    Plan](http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_4.xml#target_environments)?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *There were concerns raised, and is the advise of the Planning
        Council that "minimum required" set in eclipse.ini file be set
        on a package-by-package basis, based on that package's needs,
        instead of having same requirement for every package, even when
        not needed. But, it is formally up to the EPP project and its
        committers (and package maintainers) to decide, not the Planning
        Council ... we are just giving advise.*
          -
            *- The main argument "for" doing all packages the same way
            was that it's easier and more consistent message to end-user
            to get message "at the beginning" of trying to run, rather
            than something just "not working" (with at best a vague
            information message in the log).*
            *- The main argument "against" is that there are still some
            users of "Java 6" so why limit them if not really required
            and that its more in-line with our traditional approach (of
            not constraining projects to particular levels of a JRE).*
            *- Ian raised the use-case that p2 does not constrain
            installation, based on BREE levels. For example, if someone
            is using Java 6, and "starts off" with plain SDK (or any
            product that is not constrained to Java 7), then they can
            install features/bundles that require Java 7 (e.g. CDT) that
            p2 will allow them to be installed, but the Java 7 pieces
            still won't work, as long as user stays on Java 6 -- i.e.
            user still won't get "friendly message". I'm not sure if
            that is an argument "for or against" EPP's plans, but since
            the "plain SDK" is not going to constrain execution to 1.7,
            it seems inconsistent (and probably always has always been,
            to some degree). Projects considering constraining their
            BREEs to Java 7 may want to remember that use-case and
            document it well for end-users and adopters that Java 7 is
            required.*
