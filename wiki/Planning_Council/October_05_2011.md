## Juno Plan and Requirements

### Plan

I've updated our [Planning
Document](Juno/Simultaneous_Release_Plan "wikilink") with SR dates ... I
consider the document "done for Juno" ... except for links (and content)
for requirements and tracking. (That is, please proof read, especially
dates for SRs).

### Requirements

Previous year's document on ["eclipse
web"](http://www.eclipse.org/indigo/planning/EclipseSimultaneousRelease.php),
moved to ["eclipse
wiki"](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink"). I have
edited, for clarity and organization. Only "requirement" I've changed,
so far, it the one about 3.8 support (previously, was about 4.1
support).

*In general, everyone thought "fine", but admitted had not had time to
read carefully yet, so (I hope) still room for improvements to be made.*

*issue: is there a way to make clearer what is "normal Eclipse
Foundation requirement" and what is "release train" requirement. I think
it pretty obvious, if someone reads whole document, but TODO: will look
at changing/adding to the 3 main headings to make clearer.*

*issue: is the "using Orbit bundles" an Eclipse Foundation requirement
or train requirement? Answer: train. EF requires the CQ, but does not
specify where to get it from. In general, should be easier for projects
to get from Orbit, and avoids "inconsistent" bundles if things installed
together in unexpected ways, whether on train, or not. So it would be
odd _not_ to get from Orbit, even for non-train release. There might
be some exceptions for some projects (such as Virgo?) where "they have
existing customers that expect the bundle to be in a certain form" ...
similar to any "software migration" when existing customers exist, I
guess. In theory, such exceptions should be "equally valid" whether on
train, or not ... but there could be real "conflicts" that would
preclude being in common repo.*

*issue: is the "must be signed" requirement from Eclipse Foundation or
release train? Answer: train. Wayne clarified, if "signed or not" is
release train requirement, but Eclipse Foundation requires "if it is
signed, and distributed from Eclipse, it must be signed by the Eclipse
certificate".*

Other requirements?

*none mentioned.*

Other clarifications?

*none mentioned. But members will raise issues on planning council
mailing list, or on "talk page" of wiki. (typos and small grammar fixes
can just be made on wiki, directly, by any PC member). All PMC members
are encouraged to "watch" that wiki page, to be aware of changes or
discussions.*

### Checklist (aka tracker)

Is it worth someone investing the time to update this?

I have heard both ways, some like, some don't ... so I hope others have
some strong opinions one way or the other?

Let's first decide what we want ... then we can discuss how to get it
done, if desired.

*In general, thought to be fairly worth while, and fairly easy for
committers to fill out ... as long as no one "hounded" to do it. In
particular the "checklist" aspect was thought nice, in that helped guide
people, so especially useful to new projects. Especially important to
adopters/consumers to learn more about a project, such as "is it tested
for accessibility" (which some adopters need to know, for selling
services/products in some markets). Some of the "difficulty" to projects
is in the inaccuracies ... such as something reported as "not complete
yet" and people just have to fill in "junk URL" to get the form happy.
And, is easy in that many/much data does not change year to year ...
such as a link to milestone documents, or similar. Another way to help
"automate" some information is to provide links to the "report pages"
where things like "signed or not" and "4 part version numbers" can be
tested, instead of merely checked off as "done or not done". TODO: for
now, will mark which requirements have reports and provide a link to
main report page in requirements document. Unlikely this could ever be
"fully automated, project by project" (without a lot of effort).*

''Was mentioned that "resource constraints" to improve the "Portal
tracker" is a real constraint. As an aside, Wayne mentioned Portal may
be "completely replaced" perhaps second quarter of 2012 (so, may need
some action at that time: port code to new tracker? Move tracker out of
Portal? Achim mentioned he (they) might be interested in helping to
support/improve that tracking code, so he will discuss "internally" and
chat with Wayne about it before next meeting. (There is, some "portal
code" that no one but EF could access ... but some of it is "just" PHP
pages that others could provide patches for.) ''

## Next Meeting

  - ~~November 2, 2011 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
    Eastern).~~
      - (Achim) This is the first day of **EclipseCon Europe** (clashing
        with the 10 Years Eclipse keynote and the 10th Birthday party)\!
  - Reschedule 11/2 meeting to November 9, 2011, at Noon (Eastern)?

*agreed, next meeting 11/9*

  - Subsequent, December meeting (back to 'first Wednesday'): December
    7, 2011, at Noon (Eastern)
