## Notes

### Need chair for September, October & November meetings

Nick Boldt will be the Planning Council chair while Mélanie will be on
maternity leave (September, October & November), the next calls will be
on :

  - Sep 12 /\!\\ one week after the usual date (added to planning
    council Google calendar)
  - Oct 3
  - Nov 7

### PC Call cadence

Nick proposed to re-think the Planning Council call cadence as the
Release train cadence changed. During the call it was discussed to
change the call to 3, 4 or 6 weeks, everyone aggreed to keep the actual
monthly call cadence and that if needed new call can be scheduled at any
time.

### 2018-09 : Status

M1 done, few changes around. Fred is working on free style jobs to
jenkins pipelines. M2 is coming up and M3 is for end of august.

### Opt-in process

It was discussed to clarify the opt-in process. The projects must
declare their intent once a year, our purpose is to be sure that they
are still paying attention. It was also discussed to just use the
aggregation files to detect whose in but it appears that some projects
are not contributing to the aggregation files but they are part of the
Simultaneaous Release. Wayne will start a conversation about that topic
on the Planning Council mailing list. We agreed that project could
declare their intent :

  - to continue to participate to the SimRel before M1 of the September
    release, this means that they would participate to all the releases
    from September to June.
  - to integrate the SimRel before M1 of any releases.
  - to drop off at any time.

Mélanie will update the release requirements document accordingly.

### CQ deadline

Actually the CQ deadline was a 3 month deadline, as the entire cycle is
now compressed, Wayne proposed to put the CQ deadline to the end of the
3rd week in the release cycle, but we do not know what would be the IP
team workload. Alex said that we can't set deadline. It is convenient
for project to provide in last minutes some more dependencies used as
internal. He proposed to not provide deadlines but instead guidelines.
For example, CQ for external use should be done by M2. In general the
planning council would give advise and assume responsible behavior from
the projects. Wayne will rethink about how to manage the IP team work
queue & will continue the discussion on the Planning Council mailing
list.

### Update of the Simultaneous Release Requirements document

Mélanie updated the document and asks other to review it, it should be
updated accordingly to the opt-in process decision discussed before :
