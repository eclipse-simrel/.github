## Minutes

### Status 2025-09
- Overall state looks good
- There were two versions of Lucene
  - CVE in one version
  - DLTK was updated, which resolved the duplication

### Machine-Readable Representation of SimRel Release/Milestone Dates
- Ed already uses the markdown as kind of machine-readable format (parsing the document) for EPP
- Demands for manual adaptation of default schedule:
  - Week around Christmas (and maybe Easter)
  - Individual Holiday dates are checked against the precise schedule (including RCs and milestone dates)
- So agreement on a proposed schedule should still be made based on all relevant dates and not only the release date

### UI Best Practices Recommendation in SimRel
- https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/pull/59
- No concerns

### Copilot Integration
- See https://github.com/eclipse-packaging/packages/issues/344 for general discussion: expectation to have Copilot installed in EPP packages
- See https://github.com/eclipse-copilot/eclipse-copilot/issues/28 for license issue
- Developers ask for making their open-sourced repository private again


### AOB
- Information from Manoj: Existing Platform UI committer looking for projects/contracts


## Action Items

- Discuss ECF again in next meeting with feedback from Thomas (postponed due to Thomas being on vacation)

## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on October 1st, 2025.
