## Previous meeting minutes

  - Review [previous meeting minutes](../Planning_Council.md) if
    you'd like. That is, review them before the meeting, but if
    questions or issues with previous minutes, this would be a good time
    to bring them up.

## Agenda

### New Representative

  - Aleksandar Kurtakov will replace Doug Schaefer as the Tools PMC
    representative.

### "Java 9 Release"

  - Finalize our plans with regard to a July *Java 9 Release*
  - Should we deliver initial Java 9 support in a separate repository as
    suggested in the last meeting?

### Neon.3 update problem

  - Status report

### Oxygen M7

  - Are we on track for the next milestone?
  - Any outstanding issues related to the HttpClient problem that also
    affected Neon.3?
  - Which Guava version is intended for Oxygen? Ed Willink summoned to
    use 21.0.0
    (http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg14350.html),
    while Orbit for Oxygen M6 still contains 15.0.0 only.
