        for what has been approved. The information has been documented
        in the release requirements on the wiki [SimRel Requirementes on
        Execution

  - Discussions on web/chrome/edge support happened in the meeting
      - Strong emphasis that we have to be able to handle security
        updates in a reasonable amount of effort, this can be done by
        relying on OS shipped components, or else Eclipse project (or
        related) will need to have a regular update.
      - The Eclipse IDE WG will take that on board and coordinate with
        the Eclipse project team to make sure that proposed solutions
        address these concerns
