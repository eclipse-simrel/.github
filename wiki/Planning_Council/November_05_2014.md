    ''

## Previous meeting minutes

  - Review [previous meeting minutes](../Planning_Council.md) if
    you'd like.

## Luna SR2

  - Any issues?

    Please Review [the plan](Mars/Simultaneous_Release_Plan "wikilink")
    and the [the
    requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink").
      -
        Ready to consider these final?
        *There were no comments, suggestions, or objections, but with
        just "half the group" on the call, will consider these
        tentatively approved, and ask for others to weigh-in on mailing
        list, so by our next meeting in December will be officially
        official.*

## Progress on Action Items

  - Changed "test" project to allow easier "contributions as bundles"
    \[Thanks to Dennis HÃ¼bner for the suggestions, and some
    improvements\] -- nearing progress to "build the tests" for wider
    spread use.
  - Improved "aggregator examples/doc". (dw -- no progress).
  - \[Orbit plan (Gunnar has proposed a solution he's willing to be
    responsible for, and is working on a "proof of concept". See

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        No observable progress?

## New Business

  - *Wayne mentioned he and a group of "vested parties" are working on a
    "3 year vision" of Eclipse. He said he'll publish a draft soon ...
    or blog about the effort, but the idea is to increase focus on "user
    experience" and make sure Eclipse "stays cool" to use. He did not
    think it would effect Planning Council directly, but wanted to let
    us all know it was coming.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *I asked if anyone wanted to re-visit the "continuous release" (or
    "hot-fix roll-out" methodology) and from group on the call, the
    answer was basically "no", for the following reasons: the type of
    issue that caused so much recent discussion on cross-project mailing
    list is very rare, so even if "could be done better" no need for
    large changes in process or methods for rare events \[might be
    different if it was a critical fix that did effect everyone, such as
    a security issue?\]; most groups, such as WTP, has "designed" JEE
    package so they can roll-out off-cycle releases that are picked up
    with "check for updates" (and there, there is pretty direct
    connection with "providers" and "consumers" ... it's not like
    everyone gets the fix, whether they need it or not); and, most
    important "CDT was happy with current SR approach". :) I'm sure this
    will come up again, from time to time, and no doubt improvements
    could be made, but no "obvious solution" currently exists (that does
    not require a lot more work).*

<!-- end list -->

  - *I mentioned I should prune "callisto-dev" group soon, as is
    (normally) routine practice (but, this is first time, since being on
    Git). .*
