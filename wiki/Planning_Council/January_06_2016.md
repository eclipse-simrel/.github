## Announcements

  - ?

## Previous meeting minutes

  - Review [previous meeting minutes](../Planning_Council.md) if
    you'd like. That is, review them before the meeting, but if
    questions or issues with previous minutes, this would be a good time
    to bring them up.

## Mars Planning

  - Mars.2 issues?
  - Remember Mars.2 RCs begin Jan 15 to Jan 22.
  - Tracking participation in minor releases

## Neon Planning (and beyond)

  - Our [Neon Plan](Neon/Simultaneous_Release_Plan "wikilink") is now
    official.

<!-- end list -->

  - Should we change "maintenance" staging name now? for Mars.2? See .

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- Since "Nick votes for soon", I will ask: "Any objections"?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''No objections. And one "good idea since is currently confusing". I
    will look into implementing and see what breaks. :) ''

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- \[See also  for unreleated additional URL.\]

<!-- end list -->

  - Release Policy vs. Release mechanics. This is being tracked in .

<!-- end list -->

  -
    One proposal: have all features in EPP packages be "root features"
    and establish a procedure of adding new code to the Sim. Release
    repository "at any time" (or, say, once per month?) -- say for "hot
    fixes" only ... say after review/approval by Planning Council?
    AND, to avoid "contamination" of update site lists (without the user
    being in charge of it) change p2 install/update to not allow the
    addition of reference repositories during feature installs. But, it
    has been stated, adopters still want that ability ... so, not sure
    how "we" could ever know the difference.
      -
        Perhaps could solve with a "product preference" so EPP could
        "set" the preference one way, and adopters creating products
        could set it another way? Or, direct users to do so?
          -
            Easy for me to say "change p2" :) but ... who would do the
            work?
        Perhaps solve simply with a "policy" of "do not add reference
        repositories" (with feature installs)?
          -
            But without some way to enforce it, I think some projects
            still would.
        This "reference repositories issue" was a discussed as a concern
        at Architecture Council
          -
            Apparently there have been cases of users getting "mixed"
            installs because reference repositories are sometimes very
            broad. \[I hope I've captured the issue correctly, I was not
            there, so please correct if I read it wrong.\]
    Does Oomph solve this problem at all? Does it have a possible
    solution?
      -
        From [Ed's note to ide-dev
        list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/ide-dev/msg01043.html),
        it sounds like it solves the issue of updating non-root features
        (as long as they are "in the repository"?).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Appears there is little consensus on "what the problem is" and even
    less on "how to solve". There was a consensus that "users get bad
    bugs fixes quickly" and "users should not need to know a lot to get
    them", but other than that little consensus. It is believed that not
    all projects who use "reference repos" use them for the purpose of
    "hot bug fixes" and some may use for "anything". Are "reference
    repos" all that bad? (Those that produce "products" can "work
    around" the problem by "stripping out" that part of the content
    metadata they mirror.) Is there "another way" that is feasible, from
    a technology/manpower point of view. Discussion to continue. I do
    think current situation and many proposals are a little too "wild
    west" (uncontrolled) for Sim. Release) but a well-controlled
    method/procedure will take work.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Rolling "release" issue.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        I have sometimes heard it suggested we allow more of a
        "continuous release". Is this something we should discuss?
        Should we have some long term planning for it? Such as, what
        would it take to accomplish that?
        This could be planned with or without the "beta stream"
        mechanisms sometimes discussed.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    '' Did not discuss much during this meeting, other than to note
    similarity to above issue.''

<!-- end list -->

  - Should the ability to update from yearly release to yearly release
    be a 'requirement'?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        What would this take? (Such as features are never "just removed"
        but are replaced or transitioned?)
        What testing would projects have to do?
        May become "defacto requirement" once  is implemented.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Seemed to be no objection to "trying it" and with Neon we will "try
    it" by having the "streamless-URL" proposed in . For Neon, we will
    not use that URL automatically anywhere but users can add it if they
    would like. Will be interesting to see if many bug reports occur
    from people trying that "update to next main release" (that is, from
    Mars to Neon).*

## Neon + 1 Planning

  - How's "naming" coming?
  - Poll: <https://www.eclipse.org/neon/planning/poll.php> -\>
    <http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_dd4ff581da35bddc>
  - Current winner (with 242 total votes) and 8 days left: Oxygen

*Not quite a "majority", last I looked, but guess that is supposedly the
advantage of the voting method used. (Sort of an automatic "runoff",
conceptually.)*

## EclipseCon Face-to-face

  - Joint meeting with Arch. Council.
  - Participate on
    [EclipseCon2016/Councils_Face-to-Face](EclipseCon2016/Councils_Face-to-Face "wikilink").
  - Suggest times on [doodle
    poll](http://doodle.com/poll/7xphrzbeis678d5n).
