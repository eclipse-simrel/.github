## Topics

  - Antoine, Babel committer, would like the Planning Council to
    consider the following
    [proposal](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=261766) for
    the Galileo release train projects.
      - We all agreed that it's a good recommendation item, but not a
        must-do or should-do item. David added a comment to the bug
        above to this effect.
  - What are the implications of increasing your runtime environment
    version, TPTP asks?
      - Mostly up to your clients, and within the project's
        responsibility to decide. There are no formal requirements for
        Galileo overall.
  - Build update
      - Minor
        [snag](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=263568)
        when updating to M5
      - Please notify when your M5 build model is updated so that they
        can be added in a controlled manner to the build
