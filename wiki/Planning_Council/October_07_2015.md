## Announcements

  - Welcome Sam Davis as new (official) PC rep from Mylyn (ALM) PMC; and
    thanks to Steffen Pingel for his years of service.

## Previous meeting minutes

  - Review [previous meeting minutes](../Planning_Council.md) if
    you'd like. That is, review them before meeting, but if questions or
    issues with previous minutes, this would be a good time to bring
    them up.

## Mars Planning

  - Mini Mars.1 retrospective:

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- Some (committers) expressed ?surprise? that new projects could
    "join train". (I think "surprise" is the right word?)
      -
        \- Doug has mentioned "we need to socialize the changing rules
        better" (Anyone know how, and able, to do that?)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \-*No one in attendance knew "how to socialize better" to
        committers.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \-*During meeting, also discussed need to communicate better
        with "community", consumers, adopters, occasionally even "the
        press".*
          -
            \-*One suggestion was to ask projects "what is new and worth
            mention in marketing materials", as we do for the June
            release. It wouldn't expected to be as long a list, but,
            best to have something to say about it. Even if "bug fixes
            only", that's fine, but best to say. Might be nice to as for
            "number of bugs fixed" or even links to queries that listed
            the bugs fixed?*
        \-*It was also learned that we should communicate "slipped
        dates" better. At minimum, update the Planning Council calendar
        and various wiki's to mention the new date.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- The respin
      -
        \- Seemed a borderline case, to me. But, in the end, glad we
        did. Not just for workspace dialog issue, but also improved repo
        and packages to include only one (latest) version of
        com.jcraft.jsch. That in turn was "lucky", since Eclipse.org
        infrastructure upgraded and quietly included only "latest"
        Ciphers. Unclear if really only needs to be one, like a
        singleton, but there have been reports of "uses constraints
        violations", when both present.
        \- Then there was (some) surprise about the "one week slip" in
        releasing.
          -
            \-- Of all "lessons learned", I like the idea of "if we
            rebuild during quiet week, then automatic one week slip in
            schedule".
            \-- Not only makes gives time for others to re-test, or
            adopters to rebuild, but makes it easier for me and Markus.
            \-- I plan to codify this practice in the Sim. Release Plan.
            Any objections? See [addition to Mars
            Plan](Mars/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Mars.1 "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \-*There were no objections to adding this explicitly to plan
        documents.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- As a side observation, the workspace dialog bug was
        introduced by a code change on June 6, which (partially)
        validates our caution by allowing Buildship to join in June. The
        bug had been reported earlier (than last week of Mars.1) but a
        fix was not known before then. Thanks again to Tom Watson for
        providing the correct fix ... otherwise, would have still be a
        problem (albeit rarer) if we had re-spun with originally
        proposed fix.

## Neon Planning

  - See initial working draft of plan at
    [Neon/Simultaneous_Release_Plan](Neon/Simultaneous_Release_Plan "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Neon's 2016 Milestone Dates (M5, M6, M7, and RCs)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        See [Neon's
        Schedule](Neon/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule "wikilink")
        Similar to last year (EclipseCon is similar dates, as last year
        -- but on East Coast again\! Yeah\! :)
        Do we all agree with those dates? (That is, can we declare them
        now official?)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- *There was agreement with these milestone dates. Nothing
        controversial, or, changing from previous years.*

<!-- end list -->

  - \- Neon's Update Release Dates

<!-- end list -->

  -
    At our [last meeting](September_02_2015.md)
    it was decided to have 3 update releases (instead of current 2), and
    have them approximately equally spaced:
      -
        June (3) September (3) December (3) March \[(3) June\]
        \* I propose we plan the availability of Update Releases to be
        the same as the end of specific Neon+1 milestones.
        \- That would be M2, M4, and M6. (See Neon's schedule, for a
        rough idea of when Neon+1 milestones would be.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- *There was general agreement this seemed reasonable, but,
        some wanted more detail, such as how "test time" would line up,
        for the milestone vs. update releases. So that will be the next
        step, for me to map our some detail, and show both milestones
        and update releases on same schedule or calendar.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- This has one obvious advantage: for projects that are
        essentially working on one stream only (such as fixes-only,
        especially for first Update Release), they can submit same
        content to the Update Release, and the Milestones stream.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- *Nick suggested: Would this be a good time to look at
        changing the /staging/ and /maintenance/ URLs so they're
        \*release-specific\*? eg., instead of:*
        \* ''<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon>, ''
        \* *<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/staging>,*
        \* *<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/maintenance>*
        *... we could do*
        \* ''<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon>, ''
        \* ''<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon-staging>, ''
        \* *<http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon-maintenance>*
        *... so as to differentiate staging of update releases
        (maintenance) from staging of .0 releases (staging) and avoid
        conflicts between mars/neon or neon/neon+1 URLs.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \-*Post-meeting observation from David: If we had release name
        as apart of the URL, we would not need "maintenance" just
        "neon-staging" and "mars-staging"*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- Also, looking at schedule, the December "match up" seems a no
        brainer ... not much other time to do it?
        \- M6 matching the last Update Release is nice, since gives
        "clear focus" for M7 and the end-game of Neon+1.
        \- And Neon.1 matching M2 completes the rhythm.
        \- From those "end dates" we would count backwards, to establish
        the same RC pattern we have now.
          -
            \- I've not looked closely, but believe the first "warmup"
            RC, would be same or near the previous Neon+1 milestone.
            (one quiet week, plus 3 one week RCs, plus 1 two week RC
            equals 6 weeks) \[Is that good or bad? Do we still need that
            early warm up RC? (I'm inclined to say yes, if for nothing
            else, "new projects" joining train, and for those adding
            minor feature updates -- we still want a relatively early
            warm-up for them, similar to a update release milestone).

:\* Can we say now we all agree with these dates? (I suggest "official
vote" for next meeting, but if disagreement or concerns, speak up now\!)

:\* Has everyone had a chance to talk to their PMCs, Projects, or
Strategic Members they represent? (Please do, we need, and want,
complete buy-in from all stack holders -- that is, not so much what we
dictate, as it is what they want ... or, at least tolerate).

  - Off-cycle "hot fix" releases/patches.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- *We did not discuss this topic much, at 10/7 meeting.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    One proposal: have all features in EPP packages be "root features"
    and establish a procedure of adding new code to the Sim. Release
    repository "at any time" -- for "hot fixes" only ... after
    review/approval by Planning Council?
    AND, change p2? to "not allow" addition of reference repositories
    during feature installs.
      -

          -
            (Would likely have to be a "product preference" since some
            adopters may depend on that feature, but EPP could "set" the
            preference).
            Easy for me to say "change p2" :) but ... who would do the
            work?

        This "reference repositories issue" was a discussed as a concern
        at Architecture Council

          -
            Apparently there have been cases of users getting "mixed"
            installs, because reference repositories are sometimes very
            broad. \[I hope I've captured that issue correctly, I was
            not there, so please correct if I read it wrong.\]
    Does Oomph solve this problem at all? Does it have a possible
    solution?

<!-- end list -->

  - Rolling "release" issue

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- *We did not discuss this topic much, at 10/7 meeting.*

:\* Upon re-reading, that was another topic discussed at Arch. Council.

:\* Probably several ways to solve ... if it is a real issue? ... and,
if I understood what the "end goal" was better?

  - \- \[ACTION ITEM from previous meeting\] Wayne took as a "to do"
    item, to check with IP staff if a CQ deadline should be set for
    update releases.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- Cons (probably not needed): there are few new ones, every one
        knows the limits
        \- Pros (would be helpful): helps set expectations of committers
        and new contributors on how much can be done, by when.
          -
            (Though, still varies a lot, if "all new" large
            contribution, vs. piggy back CQ)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \-- *Wayne reported that at this time, no deadline needed. Might
    change in future, as experience and new patterns emerge. But,
    nothing obvious at this point, other than a general awareness that
    "the earlier the better" and that all requests can not necessarily
    be satisfied, depending on size and timing.*

## New Business

  - ''It was mentioned it would be nice, if not important, to
    "re-kindle" the face-face meetings at EclipseCon NA ... or, some
    other form of more active Planning Council participation.

## Next Meeting

  - November 11, 2015 - Regular First Wednesday Meeting -- on 'Second
    Wednesday'\!

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- at 10/7 meeting, decided to have on Second Wednesday, so as to
    not overlap with EclipseCon Europe (Nov. 3 to Nov. 5).
