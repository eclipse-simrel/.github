Agenda items:

  - I (Wayne) noticed that several of the contributions are more than
    one year old (some of them significantly more). I don't believe that
    it's necessarily wrong to contribute stable content, but would like
    to make sure that somebody is periodically testing configurations
    that include these contributions to mitigate the risk that we ship
    broken content.
      - Eclipse Tools for Cloud Foundry (2018)
      - Eclipse BIRT (2017)
      - Eclipse Mylyn (2018)
      - Eclipse WindowBuilder (early 2019)
      - Eclipse Xpand (2016)

## Notes

  - Eclipse Platform started to provide Linux AArch64 builds in the 4.17
    stream. If a project with native parts wants to add support for it
    and lacks access to AArch64 machine for the builds - please contact
    Alexander Kurtakov so the current machine can be attached to your
    JIPP.
