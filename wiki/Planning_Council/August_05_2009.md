        Congratulations and condolences to John Arthorne as new PC rep
        from Eclipse PMC
        Congratulations and condolences to Oisin Hurley as [new
        EclipseCon program
        chair](http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2009/07/announcing-fabulous-eclipsecon-2010.html)\!

  - Finalize [SR1 Plan](Galileo_Simultaneous_Release#SR1 "wikilink").

:\* Now considered final.

:\* A concern was raised that Platform's build is just to day, they are
not sure everyone knew and are ready for a delivery next Monday ... but,
first RC isn't critical if they can't update (but probably can).

:\*A concern raised that in general given +0 is on Monday, and finalized
on Friday, that there could be a long period before a regression
(discovered, say, on Thursday or Friday) was fixed, since Thursday or
Friday is too late for following week's Platform. But ...

::\*For one, there's nothing stopping highly dependent projects or
adopters from doing their testing earlier. For example, WTP doesn't have
to wait for the Common Discovery Repository delivery before starting
their testing.

::\*For another, exceptions can be worked out on a case-by-case bases,
patches supplied, etc., if for example, a regression was so bad it
prevented another project or adopter from doing their testing. (I would
say this is unlikely ... but it does happen).

  - Review [Planning Council/Galileo
    postmortem](Galileo_postmortem.md).

        It was mentioned (from Eclipse Platform team) that they didn't
        participate in forming these notes, but that it corresponds to
        their own team-meeting notes, except they would have also added
        the "+1", "+2" categories of dependencies may be too simplified,
        since in reality, some projects need to deliver part of their
        components, say, at +0 or +1, but another leaf component at +2
        or +3). They would also appreciate making sure that the
        simultaneous release criteria be better explained.
        We'll continually review list to make sure issues addressed,
        action plans made, owners found, etc.

  - Begin Helios Discussions

:\*similar process of having Common Discover Site

:\*similar criteria?

  -

      -
        to be in Common Discover Site
        to be in Release

    <!-- end list -->

      -
        But with graduated levels of achievement where appropriate (e.g.
        5 levels from none to excellent)
        Instead of "pass/fail", require a "statement of intent" for each
        item as part of Project Plan.
          -
            For example, some projects might declare "no intent to
            support accessibility checklists".
            Projects would still be excluded on a case by case bases, if
            felt they interfered with the process, or other projects
            functionality, but otherwise try to get more "consumer
            oriented".
        ''It was thought the above ideas worth pursuing (at least to the
        point of making more concrete, for review). Nothing firm
        decided. ''

:\*Hot Items? *No time to discuss this topic.*

      -
        Granularity: sub-Projects vs. Top Level Project?
        capabilities definitions and process?
        others?

    Notes regarding the +0, +1, +2, +3, EPP, and 'available' days
    :\*The first three milestones use a two-week window and the
    remaining milestones use 1-week windows.
    :\*The sub-deadline patterns within the windows are as follows:

| \+0    |     | \+1 | \+2 | \+3 | EPP | Available |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| Friday | Sat | Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thur      |

2-week window pattern

  -

      -


| \+0    | \+1    | \+2     | \+3       | EPP      | Available |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Friday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday    |

1-week window pattern

::\*This pattern was arrived at with a couple of considerations: a) it
is very important that teams have a consistent rhythm (so, for example,
easier for a team to "always deliver on Tuesday" rather than Monday's
some milestones, Thursdays other milestones, etc. b) it represents the
**latest** possible time to produce common-discovery site ... teams can,
still, either on their own or work with other projects to do their final
builds earlier, making their delivery available earlier to specific
teams or test groups.

::\*Remember, the +n categories represent **latest** possible time to
complete what is required of common discovery site (generally, at noon,
Eastern time, of the day). Teams have to do their builds and testing
before these common-site deadlines.

::\*In general, teams often have complicated inter-dependencies which
are not captured by the simple "+1", "+2" descriptions. In those cases,
it is up to those projects to work out their detailed inter-dependencies
and agree to a processes to satisfy what they need from each other. The
dates and deadlines listed by Planning Council, apply only to the final
deliverable to the common repository.



  - Do we have the right members? What to do about those that are
    inactive?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        For reference, there are 14 [Strategic
        Members](http://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMembersWithTag.php?TagID=strategic)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *It was decided to form "inactive" list, and work with Strategic
    members and/or EMO to get someone who can be active. Also, to better
    document benefits of participation.*

  - Next Meeting
