The following is all "proposed" to be decided during 4/7 meeting.

In particular, please consider if any "candidate names" should be
excluded, or "excluded names" moved back to the candidate list.

## Proposed instructions for doodle poll

Please vote (once only) for your favorite name for the 2011 Simultaneous
Release (the one following Helios).

The simultaneous release name is an informal "marketing name". It should
be recognizable, pronounceable, relatively distinct, and not confusable
with other software or software companies. Be sure to consider how it
sounds in context, such as "... go download the Eclipse xxxxxxxx Release
... " and how it looks in use as labels or urls, such as
http://..../releases/xxxxxxx.

See  for comments on the relative merits on these candidate names.
<https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=306864>.

This doodle poll will be open for two weeks, until April 22. At that
time, if there is no clear winner, a runnoff vote will be for the top
three contenders until May 6.
