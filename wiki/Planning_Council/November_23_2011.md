### Requirements

Review
[Requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink") for
substance and wording.

In brief, the things to focus on, for this "off cycle" meeting, are the
[proposed changes for Juno
Release](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Changes_for_Juno_Release "wikilink").

See [last meeting notes from November 09,
2011](November_09_2011.md) for detailed notes
of previous discussion. But, below is a brief summary of what we talked
about last time and actions taken.

*This meeting was not well attended, due to holidays and conflicting
meetings, so some issues may come back up at our next meeting, but at
this meeting there was general agreement with substance of the plan,
edits made so far, and that "Getting source from repositories" is worth
keeping (in semi-optional, ease adoption category), if wording can be
improved and agreed upon.*

#### The three new major headings.

  - Changed headings based on feed back from last meeting.

#### 4 (now 2) proposed new items, all marked (currently) with "\[added 10/18/2011\]"

A. Source build.

  - I removed the proposed new item and closed  as wontfix.

B. Target Environments (Platforms and Java Levels). I tried to add some
general advice, to especially help new projects, but no substantial "new
work" ... just to encourage teams to think through and document what
they support.

  - I simplified the wording.

C. Getting source from repositories. I once thought it'd be nice to
"require" the use Eclipse-SourceReference, but there was some discussion
on cross-project list that not everyone liked that idea, for valid
reasons. So, tried to word so that "its a good idea, and if you don't
use Eclipse-SourceReference, you should provide some other easy way".

*Need to discuss more? Need to clarify purpose. Is it to improve
workflow, so contributors can easily provide patches? Is it so adopters
IP staff can get a copy of all source used in a build? Or, both? Larger
question is if it is implementable. Currently there are no commonly used
tools to created team project sets (though, there are ant scripts around
that do it, such as Orbit). Currently, an Eclipse-SourceReference for
GIT is not implemented and no clear commitment to do it, despite being a
regression in available functionality, see .*

D. Provide archived p2 repositories.

  - Removed the proposed new item. Not enough agreement it was required
    to mention, though often good idea, many already do provide, and
    seemed counter to one popular builder. PLUS, we (Planning Council)
    have always resisted in the past doing anything to "make builds
    better or easier" (as it was not actually our mission), instead,
    focusing simply on what makes it easier for users to install things,
    and improve consumability by adopters. So, bad idea to include for
    many reasons (though, still a good idea to do).

#### Other requirements?

  - [SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements\#Compatibility_with_Previous_Releases](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Compatibility_with_Previous_Releases "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  -
    no time to discuss at previous meeting. Its already "required" as
    part of standard plan ... but, I think some guidance/mention in this
    document helps clarify expectations for Simultaneous Release. Any
    objections? Suggestions?

#### Other clarifications?

  - Comments/actions after the meeting based on John's note to planning
    list ... see [last meeting
    notes](November_09_2011.md) for detailed
    notes.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    I incorporated most, but not all suggestions, so further discussion
    welcome.

<!-- end list -->

  - I did some more "grouping" of like-items ...

<!-- end list -->

  -
    grouped several under "Excel in NL support" heading, as suggested by
    John
    moved 3 items up under "plan"
    moved several under a "bundle form and format" heading
    moved 2 API related items together under "APIs" (net effect was to
    move one "required" item to "optional" sections ... but, was
    basically about documenting things, anyway ... nothing "concrete" to
    (easily) test for common repo.

<!-- end list -->

  - In addition to removing the "metrics" item, I propose we remove the
    "capabilities" item

<!-- end list -->

  - Other comments/improvements to plan?

### Checklist (aka tracker)

Investigate if checklist can be improved and who can do it.

Possible solutions:

  - correct Portal, to be accurate to current list (and correct some
    minor issues, such as in some cases two fields for data were
    included, when one would have sufficed).

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        After that's done the summary PHP pages would need to be fixed
        to match the Portal data.

<!-- end list -->

  - medium budget fix: request "XML file" (similar in concept to
    "standard plan") that would have and specified schema, with standard
    headings, etc., and then someone could write XSL/XQuery scripts to
    roll-up results. In theory, someone could write a form-like "front
    end" to produce the XML files.

<!-- end list -->

  - low budget fix: provide a template (or, example) wiki page, that
    would consist of headings only ... that projects could copy and fill
    out for their project. In this approach there would be no "roll up".

*Good discussion around this issue. While no good solution is in sight
for Juno, some tactical plans made.*

*Achim and Wayne have discussed the first (high budget) item, and Wayne
said that there are not resources in Foundation to do either (neither
they themselves fix, nor for them to do the work to allow someone else
to work on "Eclipse Foundation code" to fix).*

*The second "medium budget" item was deemed too expensive, too much
work, and not fitting in with long term approach of having super-portal
that would "do it all".*

*Tactical solution was to a) disconnect current code and summaries,
leaving only the 'simultaneousrelease' field (and its summary page) but
to remove the rest; b) provide a wiki page "template" (not official wiki
template) and tell projects if they wanted their own checklist or
summary they could make a copy of that, and fill it in, as they go; c)
will require projects in Simultaneous Release to have a section where
they state "Have complied with Simultaneous Release requirements, and
have listed any exceptions below".*

*Longer term, not in time for Juno, fields such as link to rampdown
plan, link to accessibility testing, link to API policy, retention
policy, etc. will be part of the new "super portal" for projects to fill
in, or not, depending on type of release, needs of the project, etc.*

*Some of the discussion here pointed out that there is a fundamental
conflict here, which we must be careful to not lose sight of, and
explicitly keep balanced: on the one hand we want things to be as easy
as possible for projects to "release" and for committers not to have to
do one bit of anything that is "extra work". On the other hand, the
Simultaneous Release is expected to be held to a higher standard than a
normal, ordinary project release; more work is expected for those
wishing to voluntarily participate, especially with regards for
providing a solid foundation for (strategic member) adoption. The
pendulum swings ... if participation is too hard, projects will not
voluntary participate, if expectations are too low, strategic members
will lose interest and not see or get any value. Thus, important to
always discuss from both points of view.*

*To document reasons for the checklists and summary pages:*

  - *Projects have asked for it, in the past; to have a short summary to
    follow, to guide them along, especially new projects.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *It was intended as a way for Project leads and PMCs and Planning
    Council to check progress towards compliance.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *It was intended as an easy way for adopters to get quick, overall
    information about a project. For example, if a project had no
    retention policy and did not do any work towards accessibility, then
    an adopter might decide it was not suitable to include in their
    commercial product. Without such a summary, there is risk it will be
    more work for everyone (clearly for adopters, trying to find out
    that information) but also for projects, if they get asked the same
    questions frequently. Similarly, a project might be "overlooked" for
    adoption because there is no information easily available with this
    important data.*

### Other business

  - Are we failing in our mission, if common repo (as a whole) is not
    able to be mirrored?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    See
    *Off hand, quick comments were "mirroring is hard, there's many
    complications, methods, ins and outs, and probably beyond our scope
    or mission to worry too much about ... its more about the tools to
    allow and do the mirror and resolve issues." In general, I think it
    is a problem that two, perfectly consistent repositories, might not
    be consistent when taken in composite ... but ... agree its a
    problem that is not the Planning Council's concern (unless ...
    someone comes up with a specific reason our process causes it).*
