## Announcements

  - Any?

## Previous meeting minutes

  - Review [previous meeting minutes](../Planning_Council.md) if
    you'd like. That is, review them before the meeting, but if
    questions or issues with previous minutes, this would be a good time
    to bring them up.

## Mars "left over" topics

  - Requirement to use "latest Orbit" (or other pre-reqs) even in
    Maintenance releases

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        Turns out, some projects "do not rebuild, ever, for
        "maintenance" so they do not use the latest Orbit.
        Is it too much to \*require\* that they rebuild to "pick up" new
        prereqs? See bug  for why this is important. (Ideally, "new
        builds" with "new prereqs" would be easy to do. But, guess not
        always, if not used to branches, I assume.)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- *Alex promoted the proposal he wrote about on cross-project
        list. I will need to re-read that, and respond there. We
        discussed a fair amount with no resolution so will track as an
        on-going item.*
        \- I did respond to give my point of view.''
        \- Anything to add?
        \- *No one said anything*

## Neon Planning (and beyond)

### new business

  - Cloud Category?
    [bug 489467](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=489467)
    -- In general a good idea, but seems little consensus on "what it
    is". We need a good definition of what goes into it.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- *Bug had been updated. Since meeting has been updated again, and
    is now "in" as a category.*

### old (ongoing) stuff

  - Should we change "maintenance" staging name now? for Mars.2? See .

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- \[See also  for unreleated additional URL.\]

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        \- Still "todo" item. (i.e. not done yet, apologies for delay)

<!-- end list -->

  - Release Policy vs. Release mechanics. This is being tracked in .

<!-- end list -->

  -
    In M6 we changed to have (nearly) all features to be "root features.
    Now what?

<!-- end list -->

  - "Rolling release" issue.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        I have sometimes heard it suggested we allow more of a
        "continuous release". Is this something we should discuss?
        Should we have some long term planning for it? Such as, what
        would it take to accomplish that?
        This could be planned with or without the "beta stream"
        mechanisms sometimes discussed.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    '' Did not discuss much during this meeting, other than to note
    similarity to above issue.''

<!-- end list -->

  - Should the ability to update from yearly release to yearly release
    be a 'requirement'?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        **Impossible now, for Neon. Right? (for EPP Packages) Do we
        still need "streamless-URL" now?**

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        What would this take? (Such as features are never "just removed"
        but are replaced or transitioned?)
        What testing would projects have to do?
        May become "defacto requirement" once  is implemented.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Seemed to be no objection to "trying it" and with Neon we will "try
    it" by having the "streamless-URL" proposed in . For Neon, we will
    not use that URL automatically anywhere but users can add it if they
    would like. Will be interesting to see if many bug reports occur
    from people trying that "update to next main release" (that is, from
    Mars to Neon).*
