## Maintenance Schedule

### Helios SR2

2/25/2011 (Fourth Friday of February)

For detailed RC schedules, see [Service Release Schedule in master
plan](Helios_Simultaneous_Release#Service_Releases "wikilink")

RC1 is getting near ... warmup RC week of 1/17 - 1/21.

## Indigo Status

  - nearing M5

<!-- end list -->

  - Approved? exceptions for projects joining (late) in M5 (remember, if
    any of these projects do not make M5, new exceptions should be
    requested for M6).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    [Jubula](http://www.eclipse.org/jubula/) *Achimim reports "on track"
    for M5*
    [Window
    Builder](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/tools.windowbuilder/) (see
    also [intro msg on cross-project
    list](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05064.html))
    *realistic for M5?*
    [Runtime Analysis
    Tools](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/tools.rat/) (see also [intro
    msg on cross-project
    list](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05100.html))
    *realistic for M5?*
    [Enterprise Tools for OSGi (tm) Service
    Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/libra/) *Kaloyan reports
    unlikely for M5, "just being realistic". We'll re-assess at 2/2
    meeting for M6.*
    [Subversive](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05177.html)?
    *concerns expressed: inconsistent and unpredictable and unresponsive
    ... they likely need "help" from their PMC?*
    [GMF Tooling (GMF
    Codegen)?](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05133.html)
    *Ed reports it is believed its releng woes are being addressed, but
    doesn't know detailed status ... there are people, but maybe not yet
    required skills? ... it would be disruptive if not in release (some
    do depend on it) ... and, obviously, disruptive if they continue to
    "break the build".*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *The Planning Council formally approved exceptions for all 6 of
        the above projects; joining Indigo Release, in M5 ... but, with
        concerns expressed (summarized above), and much discussed. In
        particular, it is not believed to be realistic for those new
        projects still being reviewed and provisioned, especially those
        with large, existing code bases (can they even get through IP
        review?). We discussed alternatives, such as them joining in
        Indigo SR1. Also, we reminded ourselves projects can "release"
        with Indigo, but not be part of the common repository ... fewer
        requirements on them, in that case ... and users just have to
        get that code/function from those project's own sites, instead
        of central repo. The excellent point was made that its not just
        a matter of "mechanics" of getting things done in time, but also
        getting adequate "community review and testing". For an example
        (just as an example) would the "window builder" play well with
        others, or subtly change the behavior of Java Editor? And it
        might be just fine to "change behavior" ... but, need adequate
        community review and testing **before** being released to know
        if its ok, or not. There might be willingness to allow late
        comers to M6 ... but, beyond that, other alternatives (SR1, or
        project-only repos) would likely be preferable solutions. It
        mostly comes down to how "disruptive" they are ... disruptive to
        end-users, or disruptive to other projects trying to
        build/aggregate/release. In the code/benefit curve, it was
        acknowledge there is great benefit ... but not above all cost.
        So, while we approve for M5 ... we expect we will be discussing
        more at future meetings.*

<!-- end list -->

  - remember to aggregate project tracking, IP logs, docuware, etc., and
    [update project
    meta-data](Development_Resources/HOWTO/Project_Meta-Data "wikilink")
    as Wayne requested in [cross-project
    note](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05063.html).

<!-- end list -->

  - Any concrete ideas on how to improve aggregation timing or workflow?
    If so, please comment in  ... or, should I close it as "won't fix"?

## Indigo Plan and Schedule

  - [Indigo
    Requirements](http://www.eclipse.org/indigo/planning/EclipseSimultaneousRelease.php)

<!-- end list -->

  - See also [Indigo Wiki page](indigo "wikilink")

## Other business

  - Discussion on build machine QoS (JohnA):

<!-- end list -->

  -   - Is build machine contention/availability currently an issue for
        projects?
      - Do we need to adjust schedules to account for this?
      - Consider other measures such as reducing continuous or regular
        builds during milestone periods?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *There was agreement this might become a problem (has been in the
    past), but not sure if it currently is, and not sure what to do
    about it if/when it becomes a problem. Its hard to pick favorite
    projects or take away resources from some committers ... though is
    is a shared, constrained resource, so might come to that. And by
    "take away" it it meant to reduce, have various rules about niceness
    level that are enforced, etc.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *TODO: I (dw) agreed to ask webmasters if there was some way to see
    who was using what how much, as improved understanding might lead to
    better solutions.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''Long term, if it is only a matter of "peak usage", may want to
    investigate (or, encourage others to investigate:) some sort of
    "cloud" solution so during final milestone/release weeks we could
    have 10 slaves, or something, whereas most of the time we just need
    one or two. ''

      -
        '''Response: '''(from email discussion with master webmaster,
        Denis)
          -
            No resources to do "cloud computing" (unless, someone
            donates it).
            In current system, greatest bottlenecks will be hard disk
            access: "Everyone pulling CVS/SVN/Git files, writing to
            /shared, uploading to downloads, and so on takes a toll on
            disk performance. The separation of anonymous/external
            pserver to another dataset will likely help tons."
            There is no way to monitor/track CPU Utilization "by
            project".
            Specific advice to minimize risk (riskiest usage):
              -
                Building only when needed, \[and, **testing** only when
                needed\].
                not running too many builds concurrently,
                avoid scanning the file system for nothing (by using
                find, or chmod \* -R for instance),
                building during off-peak hours (Fridays, weekend),
                minimizing disk operations (copies, moves, deletes, zip,
                caching 3rd party dependencies, etc),
                respecting the [Server Storage
                chart](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Image:Build_infra_layout.png),
                avoiding hogging all the RAM...

      -
        *As Eclipse Leaders, we need to infuse "efficient use of
        resources" in our development culture ... but, as Planning
        Council, no known actions.*
        *The "cloud computing" solution was discussed and questioned ...
        wondering if it was technically feasible, with security
        concerns, and all. It was suggested that more hardware might be
        "easier" to make use of than "the cloud". Although that sounds
        like a challenging dare for someone with cloud computing
        solutions to prove or show case. (hint hint :)*

## ToDo Items

  - **It is time? ==\>** Note from Wayne, to Wayne: (from previous
    meeting) Remember to review plans starting after M4 (at latest) so
    questions can be clarified before "road map" produced.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Was there a note for this item?** Wayne teased us all with promise
    of new tools to check CQs against downloads, which we projects can
    use ourselves ... but he wasn't ready to tell us about them today
    and he'll be saying more over next few days or weeks.

<!-- end list -->

  - TODO (from previous meeting): dw to add/create add a FAQ item around
    "what to handle 3.7 vs. 4.1". Will draw from previous [working
    notes](Indigo/HowToAddress37And41Platform "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - '''New TODO?: ''' Need common pages for a) plans b) migration c)
    N\&N?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    A contributor (Hendy.rainbowpurple.com) added these for Eclipse
    project to [Indigo Wiki Page](Indigo "wikilink") ... but, shouldn't
    we have central page, with potential for each project to add links
    to their plans, migration guides, and N\&N? Is there a better way?
