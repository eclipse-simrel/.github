## Announcements

  - Welcome Jesse McConnell (new Rt PMC representative, replacing Tom
    Watson)

## Indigo SR1

First RC (warm-up) build is coming up soon (8/15-8/19). See [Indigo SR1
Schedule](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#SR1)

On the topic of "Can new things show up in Sim. Release Service
Releases?" ... we have previously agreed "yes". Any discussion?

*It was was suggested we have a FAQ to document this, and to make it
clear, those projects still need to have a "release review" per normal
EDP rules. It is up to the project to initiate that release review, and
up to their PMC to "monitor" (all) their projects to make sure they are
following the Eclipse rules, but, as with any other Eclipse Citizen, if
the Planning Council happens to notice someone might be breaking the EDP
rules, we can certainly point that out to them or the PC rep. The "new
content" in SR can be completely new, or possibly a minor bump in
feature versions. The FAQ should also strongly word the new content must
still meet all the other requirements of the Simultaneous Release, such
as signed, externalized strings, etc. In fact, the "requirement" that a
project "do no harm" might, in practice, rule out some "low level"
features from a having a minor version increase in the common
repository. In other words, adding a "leaf" project is relatively easy,
changing a low level one requires lot of communication, checking, and
testing. \[dw agreed to write the FAQ for PC to review\]*

*New FAQ written at [Can a new project or feature join a Simultaneous
Service Release (SR1 or
SR2)?](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_FAQ#Can_a_new_project_or_feature_join_a_Simultaneous_Service_Release_.28SR1_or_SR2.29.3F "wikilink")*

## Juno Release Planning

### Juno Dates

  -
    Release: June 27, 2012 (fourth Wednesday)
    SR1: September 28, 2012 (fourth Friday)
    SR2: February 22, 2013 (fourth Friday)

See [proposed plan for proposed milestone
dates](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Juno/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule).

Issue: We have a 53 week development year ... 6/22/2011 to 6/27/2012
(due to the way "fourth Wednesdays" fall) ... so what to do with extra
week?

  - M7 extra long, 8 weeks instead of 7?
  - M6 longer than usual, 7 weeks instead of 6? \<-- my recommendation,
    so that M6 ends "right before" EclispeCon?

*It was agreed we would put the extra week in M6, this year. Another
advantage mentioned is that that is API freeze milestone, so if "extra
time" is available, that'd be a good place for it. It does put the end
of M6 right up to the Friday before EclipseCon. That's good in that it
might allow fixes to be made to M6 as people prepare their EclipseCon
demos, tutorials, etc. but also has the disadvantage of having "breaks"
right before EclispeCon, and also people not being able to get "clean"
M6 copies before EclipseCon. Pros and Cons balance, was the collective
view. It has actually been "the Friday before EclipseCon" for several
years ... though, it did used to be a week earlier. We will leave the
open for one week in case others have comments/concerns, then consider
it final after 8/10*.

### Juno Requirements

#### 4.2 vs. 3.8

We will have 4.2 as primary (hence the one used for EPP Packages) but
ask participating projects to have a clear plan item titled, exactly,
"Support for Eclipse 3.8 workbench" where possible descriptions might be
similar to:

  - Not at all. No support for 3.8 based apps.

<!-- end list -->

  - We will accept bugs against 3.8 based apps, but do not test or
    compile against it.

<!-- end list -->

  - We will compile against and somewhat test 3.8, though 4.2 is
    primary.

<!-- end list -->

  - We will support 3.8 as well as 4.2, but the exact functionality may
    differ.

<!-- end list -->

  - We will support 3.8 and 4.2 equally.

## Next Meeting

  - September 7, 2011 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
    Eastern).
  - "retrospective" at September meeting.
