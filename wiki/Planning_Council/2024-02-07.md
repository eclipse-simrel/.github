### Discussions

- Discussed how to best use funded dev efforts going forward. The conclusion is that having a self managed person who can handle the review of PRs and all the other technical items previously captured in the [Onboarding mentor](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/19) dev effort
- These are the other issues that have been highlighted recently, but for now are not under consideration as the focus needs to be on the above.
  - [GLCanvas on Wayland](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/806)
  - [blank screens macOS and latest Java](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/1012#issuecomment-1925329883)
  - [SWT (and more?) support on aarch64 on win32](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/1019)
  - [Rework PDE wizards to use p2](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/issues/862)
  - [All items previously collected on board](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/boards/1208)
- This should feed into the [in person meeting Feb 27](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse-ide-wg/msg00347.html)

- [Java 21 (as runtime) and SimRel](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse.org-planning-council/msg03700.html) required a decision on "Make a decision when to update JustJ in EPPs to Java 21." and that led to the decision of "Update right after 2024-03 release and start the new stream with JustJ 21 and Java 21 content allowed."

- Ed reports that the 2024-03 release is going well and was particularly pleased with how well everyone adopted to the new guava version.
- Java 21 support in JDT may still be missing some features in 2024-03.

- There is some cross-project concern about how Java 21 is ending up unintentionally in user installs. See [WWD#1380](https://github.com/eclipse-wildwebdeveloper/wildwebdeveloper/issues/1380) and [Equinox p2#367](https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/p2/discussions/367) for details.
