## Luna SR1

  -
    Any issues?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *ECF Plans to contribute 'minor release'. No known issue with
        that. Would be good if it was communicated well (e.g. what the
        new function was, and what was **not** changing, such as assume
        function used by p2 is not changing?*
        *There is some question about 'httpcompnents' level (See  -
        Consider changing httpcomponents for Luna SR1), but seems
        impossible to have a coordinated "downgrade". Will investigate
        "moving up", but appears unlikely that would help. One
        difficulty is having the right committers have access to the
        right kind of proxy server that exhibited the regression. (see
        bug for details).*

    Remember that SR1 RC1 is just a few weeks away (and overlaps Mars
    M1).

## Mars Planning

  -
    Please Review [the plan](Mars/Simultaneous_Release_Plan "wikilink"),
    especially the
    [dates](Mars/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Schedule "wikilink"). Goal is
    to finalize the dates, if we can.
    Current dates follow same pattern as previous years.
    But there is an issue with what to do with M6, since EclipseCon is a
    week earlier than last year (and, I'm told, last year was a week
    earlier than the year before).

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *The general, if not strong, feeling was that moving M6 a week
        earlier makes it way too short for a milestone, which also makes
        M7 extremely long. The proposal is to delay M6 by a week (so
        then most attending EclipseCon do not need to worry about the
        typical "last week" milestone activities) which also has the
        benefit that then M6 and M7 are more balanced, at 7 weeks each.
        Only downside is that those that "need the latest" for
        EclipseCon (e.g. for tutorial or demo), will have to make due
        with M5 or their own custom combination of "I-builds". I will
        update the plan document with these proposed dates, but since
        small attendance today, will wait until next meeting before
        deciding it is official, in case others have other suggestions.
        No one proposed we move EclipseCon. :)*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Note, though, that even extending it one week means those providing
    +0 contributions would still be busy during EclipseCon with
    final-week milestone activities.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *After the meeting, while editing the schedule, realized that might
    be better to also extend M5 by one week. In the past, we always had
    that be one of the "7 week" milestones, since most are on holiday
    for at least a week during that period over the "end of the year".
    In other words, M5 would be 7 weeks long, M6 be 6 weeks long, and M7
    be 7 weeks long. Obviously, some tweaks could be made to avoid the
    +0 problem mentioned above ... extend M5 by a week, extend M6 by 2
    weeks (from original), so then M5 and M6 would each be 7 weeks long,
    and M7 would be 6 weeks long.*
