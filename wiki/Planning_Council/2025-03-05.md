# 2025-03-05 Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- Status 2025-03
- Change in release policy (Java version support) for 2025-09 release (JDK 24)? (Follow-up from 2024-11 meeting)
- Badges proposals: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/community/-/issues/71


## Minutes

### Status 2025-03
- No issues reported
  - Ed installed and tested everything from current Staging
  - glibc dependency issue (high version constraint) has been resolved
- JDT support for Java 24 is in good shape
  - Ed compiled platform with JDT patch for Java 24
  - New way of informing about Java release will show up directly after Java 24 release: https://github.com/eclipse-oomph/oomph/issues/134#issuecomment-2697560675

### Java Support Schedule
- Background: discussion on changes regarding schedule alignment between Eclipse SimRel and Java version support in JDT discussed in November
  - Agreed on not making Eclipse Release depend on Java version support in JDT
  - Discussed whether available Java support in Eclipse release for Java 25 can be improved (Java constants and runtime support)
- Java 24 development is already separated into multiple steps
  - In particular, constants and runtime will be integrated rather early
  - Still they are only present in beta branch and not in master to be published with 2025-03
- To improve support of new Java version in Eclipse release, constants and runtime detection would have to happen in JDT master
  - Then, without ECJ support for Java language features, Java 25 would be properly recognized
  - This was done for Java 22, but JDT Debug had issues with it --> also work in JDT Debug and JDT UI required
  - Alex wanted to work on this, but will probably not be able to do so
- Proposal: document the task regarding Java 25 and make it more public/visible to maybe have someone else pick the task

### Recognition Badges
- https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/community/-/issues/71
- "Frequent Committer"
  - Bad metrics as an issue can take long to resolve
  - In general: badges should give a good/reasonable incentive (so maybe "Bug Fixer" also gives a bad incentive, as it would, e.g., favor many irrelevant fixes or fewer relevant ones)
- Proposal: "Bug Reporter" as an additional badge
- Maybe think about expiration dates or repeated badges limited to specific time periods (like "Best Committer 2025")


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on April 2nd, 2025.
