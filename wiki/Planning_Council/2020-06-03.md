We had a short meeting today.

Attendees:

  - Wayne Beaton
  - Martin Lippert
  - Fred Gurr
  - Dani Megert
  - Nitin Dahyabhai
  - Tom Watson

The June 2020 simultaneous release is progressing as planned. No current
blocker issues.

Wayne expressed concern regarding the handful of presumably stable
projects that have not contributed any new versions of their features
for some time. It's not clear that the content is being tested and so
there may be risk that these features will break if they're installed.

Wayne will assemble a list for the July call and will propose an agenda
item to discuss what, if anything, we should do to qualify continued
participation on the simultaneous release.
