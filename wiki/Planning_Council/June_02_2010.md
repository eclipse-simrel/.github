## Helios

### Next Year's Name

Should we do over? (Just kidding)

[Indigo](Indigo "wikilink") it is

### Who will lead the Planning Council next year?

And the winner is ... myself (David Williams) to continue in this role.

### Helios Release

  -
    Post RC4 exception process?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        Question from John:

According to our schedule there is one more week of potential builds
after RC4, labeled "Helios Final". I see on the planning wiki that it
says, "only emergency fixes for very serious regressions will be
considered." I can't remember if we discussed this in the past, but what
exactly does that mean? Does it mean the release train exception process
should be used, with changes announced in advance and require approval
from others? Or, will this be left to the discretion of each project?
Unless we've already covered this, we should probably decide on that
soon. Note, the Eclipse TLP doesn't plan on any contributions after RC4
at the moment, but I just want to know the process in advance in case
something comes up...

Decided:

  -
    Autobuilds turned off
    Exceptions, requests for rebuilds can be made to cross-project-dev
    list (no need for Planning Council list).
      -
        if fairly obvious, dw will trigger the rebuild (hm, can/should
        security be changed on that hudson job?)
        or if doubt, dw will ask for further review/discussion with PC
        or PMC
        there is a risk, since our setup depends on individual project
        repositories, that someone may "break the build", that is
        unrelated to original respin request
          -
            so all projects need to use care, and make sure nothing
            changes during this time

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Let's review compliance:

        Level](http://eclipse.org/helios/planning/SimultaneousReleaseGrid.php)
        [Flat
        view](http://eclipse.org/helios/planning/SimultaneousReleaseGrid.php?showallprojects=true)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Any to kick off the train?
    Any gold stars to hand out?
      -
        Andrew Overholt and the Linux Tools Project is a shining example
        of joining the train well\!

### Maintenance Schedule

Fourth Friday of September? 9/24/2010

Fourth Friday of February? 2/25/2011

### Next Year's Schedule

Not ready to discuss details, but the problems with +1, +2, +3 category
(and short times) should be well discussed.

Similarly, Oliver brought up issue with need for better "warm-up"
rhythm, especially if a prereq project is late. (EMF's "last minute" M6
delivery added pressure to TPTP's ability to build/test in time). No
specific actions, process or remedies are known, but ... maybe a
reminder to cross-project list that intermediate or warm-up builds are
good (especially if going to be near deadline).

### Cross-Project Teams

#### Aggregation

[Planning Council/Cross Project
Teams/Aggregation](Cross_Project_Teams/Aggregation.md)

Any issues moving to new b3 Aggregator?

Should be produce hybrid p2/maven repo?

## Other business

  - Process for exceptions like "breaking API change after M6"

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        projects making the change should announce on cross-project
        the team that discovers it, has a responsibility to report is as
        a "breaking API change" (don't just swallow it)
          -
            it might have been an accident or oversight and can be
            repaired for others
            even if not (even if it really is required) it is a good way
            to document the issue so others know about it.

<!-- end list -->

  - Should we have a combined/joint "migration guide" for all Helios
    projects? A central jump-off point?

## ToDo Items

## Next Meeting

July 7. Have our yearly "feedback" session.
