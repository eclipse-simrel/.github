## Review of outstanding actions

### Accessibility

The [Accessibility plan](2023-05-03.md#accessibility) is still outstanding.
The SAP's ABAP Development Tools team have usability experts on staff ([see matrix chat](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-ide-general:matrix.eclipse.org/$Zbqh3dhE4SRx4OU21qBLlsfeMGDcZ20xm06-NOhdJvY)).
**Action (Jonah)** Reach out to that team to see if they can help with keeping Eclipse IDE the most accessible friendly IDE.

## 2024-06 Status

Nothing special to report here - the release is now progressing normally following the earlier cancellation of M3 due to signing issues ([[cross-project-issues-dev] No M3 build will be produced - RC1 is next week](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg19907.html))

## 2024-09 Status

There are no large/disruptive changes on the horizon for 2024-09 that affects all projects.
There is some concern over signing performance due to the new hardware signing as a result of the new certificate.
See [Signing service performance appears to be very badly degraded (helpdesk#4680)](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/4680) for more information.

## Review [board](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/boards/1208) 

The planning council reviewed the state of the board in light of funds still available in the 2024 budget.

- [#29 Use semantic highlighting to mark the relevant region of a TextBlock](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/29) and its priority has been raised accordingly.
  - This issue can immediately be opened up and [Jonah](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/jograham) (**Action**) to highlight this with [Thomas](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/thomasfroment)

- [#17 Linux GTK platform support](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/17)
  - This issue will be opened up if the the timeline is such that Eclipse will fail within the next year (approximately). If Fedora or Ubuntu upcoming releases expect to stop working with current GTK implementation of SWT then this becomes an immediate issue. Jonah (**Action**) to investigate current and upcoming state.

- hidpi + multi-monitor
  - Substantial fixes and improvements for this on Windows are expected to be merged in time for SWT 3.33 M1 aka 2024-09 M1.
  - The open issues in this area [#22](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/22) and [#23](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/23) will maintain their undecided priority. This may change if it is identified that there is a lack of parity between Windows and other platforms.

- Competitive analysis
  - To identify what the Eclipse IDE for Java developers needs to complete to remain competitive one idea is to complete a competitive analysis to identify what the biggest areas that the planning council could then focus on. [Manoj](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/mpalat) (**Action**) will aim to define what this task might look like
  - Completing a wider competitive analysis against Eclipse IDE for all current products needed too, along with Eclipse as a platform. For now nothing is planned in this area until after Manoj's work identified above.

- All planning council members should be identifying issues important to their PMCs/Sponsoring organizations to prioritize
  - One concern is that we have under representation from some projects, e.g. no one from Technology PMC attends regularly. The concern is that there are under resourced projects that are so under resourced they don't even have anyone to share with the planning council where the issues may be.
  - The planning council should proactively use the spreadsheet collated by Ed to ensure that projects of highest interest to Eclipse IDE Working Group are adequately represented.

- JakartaEE support
  - Brief discussion on current state of JakartaEE support in Eclipse IDE. JakartaEE does work in Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers, but support for new features are incomplete.
  - [Nitin](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/nitind) (**Action**) to share a few examples of open bugs for planning council to consider converting into top issue board entries.
  - One challenge for IDE WG is that member organizations don't use much JEE.

## Next meeting

A reminder that the next meeting is scheduled for July 3rd, 2024.
