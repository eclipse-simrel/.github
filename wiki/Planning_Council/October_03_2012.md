## Announcements

## Juno

  - SR1 out and on time. Thanks\!

  -
    Well, sort of. "Updates" of EPP packages had to be disabled, due to
    a bug for Mac users, where the update operation would delete the
    eclipse.ini file.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Looks like solution nearly in hand and (I'm assuming) EPP will need
    to respin at least EPP repo (but, we should not have to respin
    common repo).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Unsure of plans (or recommendations) for re-spinning EPP
    downloadable packages. They are essentially correct, but (I think)
    if not re-created then those that unzip an SR1 package will
    immediately be offered an update (that basically does nothing ...
    just a few IU versions change). I don't think that'd be so bad ...
    but ... the final call is up to EPP (i.e Markus).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The surprising thing is that this problem was not noticed during
    testing. Guess no one well tests EPP updates on Mac's?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Will leave up to Markus to decide if to respin/replace
        downloadable packages. PC would be fine either way*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *We should encourage more/better early testing, somehow ...
        better enlist community?*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Ian pointed out we need to test the case where someone has
        already had their eclipse.ini file removed ... would they get
        the "update" and get the eclipse.ini restored? Or, maybe not,
        since no artifacts actually installed? Just a reminder to test
        that.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Issue "in community" about having two streams of EPP builds. See .

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The goal in our meeting to decide what action to take and/or how to
    respond in the bug.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    In mailing list, Ian provided these references to the issue, which I
    wanted to paste in here, to make sure easy to find.

    *The PC discussed, and decided, that we would not like to see 2 EPP
    packages provided from Eclipse Foundation, and below I've tried to
    capture the main points of discussion.*
      - *The primary reason is that the 4.x stream is the strategic
        direction. That is what we want to encourage people to use and
        at least for many people, it works fine, if not great. We, the
        PC, and Eclipse project, are committed to improving that 4.x
        stream, particularly the performance problems that effects some
        users and use cases to the point they consider it unusable. We
        recognize that's terrible, if people feel they can not
        productively use it, but we don't feel in the big picture of
        things it is so dire that we must "back peddle" or provide extra
        packages. Better to focus on making 4.x better.*
      - *Would give confusing message to community, and seems a little
        ill-timed. Kepler will be out before you know it. That is, seems
        a short term solution for (hopefully\!) a short term problem.*
      - *Also mentioned that we (the Planning Council or Eclipse
        Foundation) are not really in the "packaging business". Yes, we
        do want to make things easier for users to "get started", but
        many companies package all sorts of distributions, based on 4.x,
        3.8, 3.7, 3.6, etc., and let users/companies get exactly what
        they want ... and many are quite happy staying on 3.6 or what
        ever ... but, ease-of-use is not our (Planning Council's) only
        goal ... we primarily want to get Eclipse projects coordinated
        and headed in the same, strategic direction. We are sympathetic
        to those that like the convenience of getting one download with
        everything they want, but we want to encourage focus on the
        strategic direction.*
      - ''Technically, 3.8 is not "part of Juno". Each project decides
        what it wants to contribute and the Eclipse Project PMC choose
        4.2. While, technically, there is no rule against EPP producing
        what ever kind of packages it wants to (3.8, 3.7, 3.6, etc.),
        their role to date has been to draw from the (strategic) common
        repo and create packages from that. Even if they did produce
        different packages, it would still be up to us (the Eclipse
        Foundation) to decide what to put on main "download page". ''
      - *I should note, that technically, it would not be a huge amount
        of work to mechanically crank out more packages, but there is a
        lot of "corollary" work needed to test, track bugs, sort through
        issues ... and, its hard to know, what surprising things might
        be found if not well planned, coordinated, and tested ahead of
        time. In other words, there would be risks and unknowns in
        providing more packages or repos.*
      - *As far as "actions" we (the PC) could take, we didn't have
        anything too specific, though we should/could probably do a
        better job of encouraging early testing. Many of the problems
        being reported are problems the platform team, by itself, would
        likely never have seen on their own and (in most cases) are
        having a difficult time reproducing -- though there is no doubt
        they are real (and very serious) problems for those users
        experiencing them. We greatly appreciate the community's help in
        finding ways to reproduce the issues and/or help fix them and/or
        help test fixes when possible.*
      - *There was one suggestion that the Eclipse Project consider an
        early SR (before February) if great progress was made. John did
        share that the Eclipse PMC has discussed that with arguments on
        both sides ... it would distract committers from other work, but
        they (the PMC) are interested in the idea of "faster release
        cycle" (seems many browsers, etc., are doing more of that these
        days), but they think they should be well planned and
        coordinated, not reactionary to fix particular problem or set of
        problems. So, while not completely ruled out (I don't think) it
        sounds very unlikely and should not give anyone a false
        impression (or "false hope") that there might be an early
        release. I pointed out that projects are free to release anytime
        they like, and do not necessarily have to be only at SR1 and SR2
        (WTP, Mylyn, and EGit, do it all the time), but it is a larger
        (PC) discussion if considering new common repo or EPP packages.
        There is a long standing issue that most EPP packages do not
        "see" updates automatically, if EPP itself is not updated. While
        this is not an unsolvable problem (see ) someone would need to
        solve it, and it would not help in the short term for this
        particular problem (since a user needs to start off with the
        right "version" (metadata) for all of its components to be
        update-able automatically. But, this situation highlights the
        need for that bug () to get some attention?*
      - *I (dw) will update the bug () as "won't fix" but emphasize we
        appreciate the suggestion and community feedback, know that is
        was well intended, but have decided against it for the strategic
        reasons mentioned above.*

## Kepler

### Kepler Requirements Planning

  - [SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Begin discussion of requirements, if changes needed. To the extent
    possible, I suggest we start with high level issues this month (such
    as, should any be added, removed?) and perhaps finish up with
    wording changes for clarification (if any) next month.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''Didn't discuss much. I brought up issue of low compliance to
    "greediness" issue, and as far as I know, to define everything in
    features is the only way for adopters to provide patches ... so ...
    either I need education, or better educate others on why important?
    Or ... maybe others don't need patches? What's alternative? New
    release? (which, adopters can not do "on their own", typically, such
    as for a "hot fix" for one customer). ''
