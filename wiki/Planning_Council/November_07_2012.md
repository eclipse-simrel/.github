### Kepler Requirements Planning

  - [SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Discuss requirements. Changes or clarifications needed? Or, approve
    "as is", unchanged from Juno?

::\**We will formally "approve for Kepler" at our December meeting,
though we believe the document is pretty much ok as-is.*

::\*''One question that came up was "What does the API requirement mean,
exactly?" (where projects must document their API policy and their use
of non-API from other projects). The brief answer was "we leave it up to
each project, we don't police it". But that the purpose is so that
adopters can better understand what is considered API ... that they
might want to use ... and/or if a project is "API clean" with respect to
its use of code from other Eclipse projects. This in turn led to a brief
discussion of "if we don't enforce it, is it really a requirement", but
that applies to all the items in the "Required for good adoption"
section of the document. I think still valuable to have that section
since it means it would be a legitimate bug if an adopter asked a
project "what is your API policy" or pointed out in a bug "you use
non-API from project B which prevents us from doing X". If/when/how the
project "fixes" those bugs is still up to them, but they would valid
bugs and it would be incorrect for a "Simultaneous Release Project" to
say "Invalid bug, we don't care about that".
TODO: Ian will see if wording can be clarified/improved or if current
wording suffices. ''

::\**Another comment came up on the "greediness" requirement. It is
thought the Sim. Rel. requirement is correct as written, but that the
community (and ourselves) need more education on why it is important ...
that is, why use "greedy=false" for runtime optional bundles. I think
that one reason is that users (and adopters) may not want to include
those things that are installed simply as function of what repository
they point p2 at, but, maybe more important, that if such as "optional
but greedy" requirement pulled in an additional bundle (or bundles) that
it would be impossible for an adopter to provide a "feature patch" for
those optional bundles ... if those optional bundles just so happened
cause some critical issue in their product for a customer. This should
all be confirmed and if confirmed some encouraging, educational
reminders be given to the participating projects. But, at the moment, it
is not thought the wording in requirements document needs changing (i.e.
if a project refuses to go along, they would not be denied
participation).*

::\**The document could be "polished" and some of the "removed"
requirements (which are currently in strike-out font) be literally
removed ... while "changes" are interesting going from one year to the
next, we don't need to maintain that "history" forever.*

## Other Business

  - Any discussion about  - Include workswith in simultaneous release?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    I closed as "won't fix", but glad to hear any further discussion or
    opinions.
      -
        *No discussion and Steffen confirmed all is well and the
        clarification appreciated.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *There was a problem for one member getting in through the "North
    America" number for Asterisk service. Just kept getting busy signal
    for 10 or 12 minutes.*

## Next Meeting

  - December 5, 2012 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
    Eastern).
