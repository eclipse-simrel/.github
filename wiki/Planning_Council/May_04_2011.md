## Announcements

  - ?

## Indigo Status

  - On track for M7? and beyond?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *No issues raised*

## Name Indigo +1

  - FWIW, "Juno" has passed EMO sanity check and review, so its
    official.

## Juno Release Planning

(See also [notes from previous
meeting](April_06_2011.md).)

I've moved "working plan" to
[Juno/Initial_Working_Plan](Juno/Initial_Working_Plan "wikilink") for
more public readings.

  -
    *Good discussion with good feedback (positive and constructive),
    though still not much known in terms of concrete plans of (sub)
    projects, so would be good to get that, if possible, by June. But,
    others were quick to point out, probably won't know much about Juno
    plans for months to come, not by next month.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Concern was mentioned the proposed plan still reads with a little
    too much emphasis on 3.8, as though 4.2 wasn't ready yet.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''Perhaps wording could be improved ... perhaps to change emphasis
    to "state concrete plans for 3.8 early", supported or not, tested or
    not, respond to bugs or not, same function or not in both streams,
    etc., so adopters and downstream projects know what to expect? And
    to include better wording as to the purpose ... "The Planning
    Council encourages, as good Eclipse citizens, we should support
    adopters that can not make the transition completely to 4.x stream
    yet". Or similar (that is, explicitly, it is not because 4.2 is not
    ready). ''

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *It was mentioned, that some projects, such as the Platform's JDT,
    might end up "splitting streams", not even necessarily because of
    the split workbench, but they might tie down 3.8 as a
    maintenance-only stream, and put new feature/functions in 4.x only.
    They haven't decided that yet, just mentioned it as a possibility.
    \[And, if anyone is wondering, the 3.x stream would contain the Java
    7 support, since that's largely done already in 3.x stream.\] It was
    pointed out this might have big impact on downstream projects, such
    as Web Tools ... unclear if downstream projects would have to split
    streams in such cases, or double-up on testing two version of JDT,
    as one example, and those downstream projects might have to pick one
    or the other to focus on (and it might not be 4.x). Put another way,
    if there is a potential split stream for every project, then the
    complexity would grow quite large. Maybe too large and complex to
    cover in our Simultaneous Release Plan? At some point, we might have
    to say, we as the Planning Council are only concerned with one
    stream, and only those that want to participate on that stream, ...
    and any other configuration is outside the scope of Planning
    Council's yearly release. Just a possibility.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *It was also mentioned that early testing, of Indigo stream and "a
    large IBM adopter product" has gone well on 4.x stream so the
    Platform team has high confidence in compatibility layer.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *There was, still, a general feeling that "4.2 as primary platform"
    would be a fine to great plan. More a question of what to do/say
    about 3.8. The council was reminded that 3.8 was deemed important by
    some members, not even necessarily for their own stuff, but
    sometimes there are dependencies or add-on tools that are outside
    Eclipse and outside members control that they still want to support
    or work with. I'm not sure we'll ever know concretely the degree of
    that? And, it is even unclear if that's a theoretical concern, or if
    there are already specific, known cases?*
