## Minutes

### Schedules 2026-03 and 2026-06
- https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/pull/63
- No concern

### Java 25 Release
- JustJ release is out since today
  - No Temurin build for WoA (AArch64 for Windows) yet
- Windows defender exclusion does not seem to work
- Security manager removal
  - May require cleanup in Platform, INI files etc.
  - Products with security manager configuration in INI will not start anymore
  - Requires EPP update together with JustJ to avoid that products do not start
- EPPs will not auto-update JustJ to newest version
- Testing
  - Ed tests products manually with latest Java version
  - Tests for SDK are executed for Linux for a while
  - Initial test run for Windows with one finding regarding deletion of read-only files

### CBI Resources
- Number of CBI resources very limited
- Everyone should check if their company have unassigned resources: https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/cbi/wiki#assigning-resource-packs-to-a-project
  - In particular dedicated agents for Windows/MacOS would be useful
  - Should be assigned to Releng JIPP

### ECF
- Follow-up from [2025-08-06](2025-08-06.md#action-items)
- ECF started doing releases again
- Nothing urgent to do

### Copilot
- Lars Vogel started to add Copilot instructions to repositories
- First experimental Copilot-generated PRs for Tycho
- Guidelines for AI-generated content from architecture council: https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse.org-architecture-council/msg04842.html
- Question on using/funding Copilot Pro plan on GitHub
  - Several companies have separate accounts or even enterprise instances of GitHub with according Copilot plans
  - Foundation will probably not pay for this in general (but they, e.g., pay for LFS support)
  - Eclipse IDE WG could be asked to pay for committers of Eclipse project(s)
