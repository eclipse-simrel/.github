        Good, brief discussion on this topic in general, for next year.
        May want to be more creative and consider multilevel categories,
        wizards that could help narrow interests (and "include source"
        checkbox choice), should also better represent _the_ packages
        that are available from EPP (e.g. "RCP Developer").

<!-- end list -->

  - PC Position on off-cycle releases and use of discovery site (and
    EPP)? This came up in discussions about a Pulsar package.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        Conclusion: we do not want to support off-cycle releases. But
        with following compromise: If a project still met all the normal
        "release criteria" set forth as must-do's by PC then they could
        introduce something new during SR1 or SR2 (that is SR1 and SR2
        can have more than service, if important, and must-do criteria
        met). The reason for not supporting things off cycle was a. it
        is more work to support it, b. there is no opportunity for
        "simultaneous release" testing, c. it would dilute the meaning
        of "simultaneous release".

        Are we happy with "must do" compliance?
        Judging from items not marked, it appears these are the projects
        of worst quality (or, worst adopter readiness?):
