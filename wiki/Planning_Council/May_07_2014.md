## Previous meeting minutes

  -

      -
        Let's discuss "EclipseCon meeting" -- as final topic today --
        any "actions" for Planning Council to track?

    [EclipseCon face-to-face](March_16_2014.md)

    [Previous "first Wednesday"
    meeting](April_02_2014.md)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *- Briefly discussed "patched packages" effort, if anyone had any
    sense if used/appreciated by community (i.e. was it a success?).
    Markus noted there was approximately 20K downloads, which is small
    compared to "main release" ... but ... such numbers are hard to
    interpret (i.e. the 20K might be a very important group of Eclipse
    community ... hard to know ... but, no doubt at least many people
    appreciated having them).*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *- I mis-reported the number of "java8patch" downloads, directly
    from Eclipse Project repository. As of today, there has been roughly
    13000, not the "1000" I mis-reported during meeting.*

## Luna Planning

  -
    Any issues with M7? RCs?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *None known other than BIRT*

## Mars Planning

  -
    Any early issues?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Briefly discussed if we are meeting diverse needs of community.
        Some indication that some adopters (still) want **pure** service
        releases ... while others (especially individual users) want
        "latest and greatest", even if contains some regressions or new
        bugs.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *No in depth discussion, but some did note issues of how/if IP
        Process would have to change (say, to have monthly "releases"),
        some noted that "pure service releases" are important to some
        adopters "internal processes" of producing products (i.e. they
        may have one process for "bug fixes only" another process for
        "new features"). Some also wondered if "new feature releases"
        are that common, since often to accomplish that, it depends on
        multiple projects cooperating ... say, for hypothetical example,
        perhaps the Platform needs to change/add an API, for someone
        else to implement a new feature and it's (relatively) rare that
        project's goals/objectives all line up (on a frequent, such as
        monthly, basis). Though, it is obvious that "new projects" such
        as EGit, etc., can often add new features independent of what
        others do.*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *I believe to make any progress on "doing things differently" we
        need to better define what "continuous release" means, for a
        large collection of Open Source projects ... Its very different
        from how a corporation might define it (where they can strictly
        define processes that everyone must follow) and different than
        how one Open Source project might define it (such as some, make
        a distinction between a "release" that has no maintenance (other
        than the next release), and only occasionally define one of
        those as a "long term support" release, which would get
        maintenance (only) -- and similar statements about "API" ...
        perhaps no solid API in "short lived" releases, but strict API
        in long term releases. So ... discussion to continue. Any
        volunteers to draft a straw-man definition of terminology for
        Eclipse releases?*

      -
        ''Very briefly discussed  - Consider banning contribution of
        mutable repositories. I think everyone was sympathetic to the
        issue, but some weren't sure if it was "that big of a deal" for
        milestones, etc., which I think have since been answered in bug.
        I expressed my own reservations about "caches" and "locks" (but
        not my concerns about use of words such as "ban" -- tools not
        rules) ... but am happy that others are finally having some
        similar concerns that I've long had -- which we discuss at least
        every year -- and so far much resistance to "doing extra work",
        but sounds like some are willing to invest in tools to make it
        easier. I'll comment in bug soon (but ... I think I should do
        one of my action items below first. :) ''
