## Announcements

  - Eclipse Platform has officially stopped building AIX Motif and Linux
    Motif.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Helios SR2

2/25/2011 (Fourth Friday of February)

For detailed RC schedules, see [Service Release Schedule in master
plan](Helios_Simultaneous_Release#Service_Releases "wikilink")

## Indigo Status

*M3 coming together roughly, but good part of that is at least people
are contributing/participating.*

## Indigo Plan and Schedule

  - [Indigo
    Requirements](http://www.eclipse.org/indigo/planning/EclipseSimultaneousRelease.php)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *All agreed it was ready, acceptable, with one exception. The
    requirement wording on 'jarred bundles' needs to be improved so no
    explicit exception required (it is required for any requirement in
    that section) and to also make it more generic and easier for a
    project to document why a bundle is not jarred. Or, maybe even
    detail when it should be documented, and what is an automatically
    acceptable?*

<!-- end list -->

  - Discuss "once in always in". Is there a
    [proposal](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/eclipse.org-planning-council/msg01842.html)
    to change this?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''No proposal to change, but given the discussion and
    misunderstandings, some wording should be improved, maybe 'once
    participating, always participating', or 'participation is
    continuous', or something. Plus, should improve the wording of
    'Exception process' to better emphasize its purposes: a) improve
    communication, b) improve PMCs shepherding their own projects (not
    the planning council, or planning council chair), and c) be sure
    decision point is not just one person (the planning council chair)
    but is instead a group effort. ''

Suggestions during (previous) meeting:

  - Make explicit that to be in repo, feature includes must be strict,
    so installs or builds are reproducible. (Even if there might
    eventually be improvements that allow additional features, with
    loose constraints ... but "minimum" requirement is the strict
    inclusion. Unclear what loose requirement solution will be. Note:
    the strict requirements are the way things are currently done ...
    just best to make explicit, since it has come up before.

<!-- end list -->

  - Move capabilities to "good citizen" section (and check wording to
    make clear that to document "not supported" is one option ... or,
    possibly "we don't know what this means" :).

<!-- end list -->

  - Consistent license. No real change to requirement, but should
    provide pointers to bugs where standard "user agreement" may change
    (to include EDL) and where p2 may be improved to allow pointer to
    URI ... or something.

<!-- end list -->

  - Add a "must do" to be in EPP package, must run on/test on Eclipse
    3.7.

<!-- end list -->

  - Add a "should do" to have a 4.1 theme item in plan to describe what
    project is doing for 4.1 (and give some examples).

Tracking "setup" required from Foundation in

See initial [Indigo Wiki page](indigo "wikilink")

Review: There is a subtle implication of specifying Java 6 as "minimum
runtime" requirement. Currently, we require contributors to use Java 5
when using pack200, since if not, and if involves a jar that contains no
Java (e.g. source or documentation) then it can not be unpacked with
Java 5, Java 6 would be required. This has been a headache for people
since for many it means tweaking build scripts so an "old" (1.5) VM is
used for that one step. During aggregation, we purposely use Java 5 to
catch errors in this regard. For Indigo, I propose we not worry about
being consistent here, and just use Java 6 during aggregation. Some
projects may still want to use 1.5 VMs to do their pack200 ... if their
adopters want it ... but I see no reason for mass consistency here ...
if Java 6 is assumed to be minimum runtime VM. Any issues? Dissent?

  -
    *Some concern expressed, but mostly a matter of letting people know
    and documenting options. For example, for projects that **want**
    compatibility with VMs less than 1.6, they still can, of course, but
    will no longer get "built in" test from aggregation. Plus, should
    make clear, even a VM less than 1.6 can still use a pack200 (or, an
    unpack200 executable) from another VM, such as a 1.6 distribution,
    and [specify it on their command
    line](Pack200#Pack200_Executable_location "wikilink") using
    `-Dorg.eclipse.update.jarprocessor.pack200`.*

### Issues and Proposal for 3.7 versus 4.1

  - See working notes in
    <http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/HowToAddress37And41Platform>

## Other business

  - ''TODO: I (dw) agreed to make initial +1, +2, ... table for project
    signup. ''

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        Done. See
        [Indigo/Participating_Projects](Indigo/Participating_Projects "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - Eclipse Platform 4.1 must move to be +1 because of dependency on
    EMF. We should discuss how this will be coordinated because there
    may eventually be cyclic dependencies (JohnA).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''John opened  to see if part of emf could be +0.

<!-- end list -->

  - Discussion on build machine QoS (JohnA):
      - Is build machine contention/availability currently an issue for
        projects?
      - Do we need to adjust schedules to account for this?
      - Consider other measures such as reducing continuous or regular
        builds during milestone periods?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *There was agreement this might become a problem (has been in the
    past), but not sure if it currently is, and not sure what to do
    about it if/when it becomes a problem. Its hard to pick favorite
    projects or take away resources from some committers ... though is
    is a shared, constrained resource, so might come to that. And by
    "take away" it it meant to reduce, have various rules about niceness
    level that are enforced, etc.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *TODO: I (dw) agreed to ask webmasters if there was some way to see
    who was using what how much, as improved understanding might lead to
    better solutions.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''Long term, if it is only a matter of "peak usage", may want to
    investigate (or, encourage others to investigate:) some sort of
    "cloud" solution so during final milestone/release weeks we could
    have 10 slaves, or something, whereas most of the time we just need
    one or two. ''

<!-- end list -->

  - ''Tom wondered if we need a "central" patch repository ... that
    could be "built in" to all versions of Eclipse. It was suggested to
    try to keep at project level, but agreed, some improvements might
    make that better. For example, if in EPP packages, there was more
    than one top level feature? Also, there maybe should be some other
    attributes identifying patches, such as "security fix", or something
    ... as some people may want to turn off checking for routine
    updates, but turning off security fixes should probably be a
    separate decision, as it is on many OS platforms. I was so excited,
    I opened . Plus, later, I opened  to improve the EPP package update
    story, if possible. ''

## ToDo Items

  - *Note from Wayne, to Wayne: (actually from last meeting) Remember to
    review plans starting after M4 (at latest) so questions can be
    clarified before "road map" produced.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *Wayne teased us all with promise of new tools to check CQs against
    downloads, which we projects can use ourselves ... but he wasn't
    ready to tell us about them today and he'll be saying more over next
    few days or weeks.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *dw to sort out tracking path.*
