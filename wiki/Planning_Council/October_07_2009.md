### Criteria and Process

Introduce and overview [Eclipse Simultaneous Release
Document](http://www.eclipse.org/helios/planning/EclipseSimultaneousRelease.php).

It is in cvs repo /cvsroot/org.eclipse in www/helios

Notes from meeting:

  - Sounds like the "mature only" item will get some discussion. Some
    pointed out it encourages and trains projects as they are learning.
    One pointed out they are a lot of work :) (i.e. break the builds
    most often, etc.) Some mentioned it may motivate them to do what's
    required to graduate instead of floating along in incubation. It was
    also mentioned that Eclipse as a whole is getting mature enough that
    there are lots of mature projects and that should be the focus of
    the common discovery site. (There were not that many mature
    projects, or incubating projects, a few years ago when we first
    agreed to let in incubating projects. No one mentioned a need from
    strategic members (or, perhaps, if they do, just a 'release' is
    enough, no need for common repository?). It was also mentioned that,
    some believe, what is in the common discovery repository should be
    the best that Eclipse has to offer for casual end-users who are
    "just exploring" and should not be a place for "marketing" or
    "experimental prototypes". There should be other mechanisms for
    those things.

<!-- end list -->

  - It was mentioned that the "web app" method of tracking items seemed
    to some people like "creating a new tool when bugzilla is available
    with no investment". But, bugzilla is too hard to use and create
    reports for and create initial items, according to others views.
    But, it does depend on how much effort it would take to create the
    web-app. So, that's the next step. It was also suggested (by the
    same person :) that the "exception process for criteria items" be
    incorporated into the web-app so it's all documented in the same
    place. (To illustrate, you could document exceptions in bugzilla,
    but it would be hard to pull that data out of bugzilla, without a
    bunch of error prone conventions).

<!-- end list -->

  - There was some discussion of just how immutable repositories should
    be, with no particular conclusion. I did open
    [bug 291637](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=291637)
    for related issues.

<!-- end list -->

  - Overall, seemed most like new structure and avoidance of "must
    do/should do" terminology.

### Proposed (initial) Cross-Project Teams

#### Aggregation

  -
    John Arthorne (Platform)
    Thomas Hallgren (Buckminster)

#### Accessibiity

See
[Cross_Project_Teams/Accessibility](Planning_Council/Cross_Project_Teams/Accessibility.md)

#### Capabilities

  -
    Tim deBoer (IBM/WTP)
    Oleg Besedin (Platform)

#### Structure of Common Discovery Site

  -
    users vs. extenders (minimum runtimes vs. SDKs)
    runtime targets vs. tools
    hierarchical categories (are more levels required?)

#### How to track

  -
    Web App (form based). Need concrete proposal for sizing.
