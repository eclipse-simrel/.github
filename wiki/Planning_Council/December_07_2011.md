## Announcements

  - Any?

## Indigo SR2

  - Anything?

## Juno Plan and Requirements

### M4

  - Any issues? Everyone in? Any exceptions known?

:\* *John reminded us that the platform is moving to "Jetty 8" for the
Help system in M4, which carries along other 3rd party prereq changes,
such as Javax.servlet. (Though, has been well discussed on
cross-project, and else where).*

:\* *We wondered if recent Hudson change would effect our ability to
deliver M4 on time. (So, far, we think not, but need to monitor).*

  - Thanks to Wayne for handsome ["participating
    projects"](http://eclipse.org/projects/releases/releases.php?release=juno)
    page.

:\* *Compliments and kudos given during the meeting ... "why didn't we
know about this nice history of releases before?\!" :)*

  - Yearly reminder to Wayne: allow some time in January to consolidate
    plans for "Road-map" to make sure you have what you need for March
    board meeting.

### Requirements

Review
[Requirements](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements "wikilink") for
substance and wording. See [last meeting notes from November 23,
2011](November_23_2011.md) for notes of
previous discussion.

The things to focus on, for this meeting, are

  - the [proposed changes for Juno
    Release](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Changes_for_Juno_Release "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - in particular, the new requirement: [Documenting
    compliance](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Release_Review_and_compliance_to_requirements_documentation_.28approximately_RC3.29 "wikilink")
    including the paragraph on "Tracking and Compliance" on our [Juno
    Wiki page](:category:Juno "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - and, since last meeting was not well attended, we will confirm,
    again, everyone supports the new requirement asking to [make it easy
    to get released
    source](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Make_it_easy_to_get_released_source_from_repository "wikilink").

*Those attending thought plan was "ok" or "good". Sill some concern
about length (not so much number of items ... just that it takes a while
to read) but no concrete suggestions (and, it was mentioned, better than
it was). Hopefully can improve a little every year?*

*I will send note to planning list, ask for any other comments by
Thursday 5 PM Eastern, from anyone who could not attend meeting.
Otherwise consider it "done" and send note to cross project list on
Friday. (We can make wording or clarification changes anytime, but do
not change any substance after M4).*

#### Other clarifications?

  - Other comments/improvements to plan?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *None*

### Checklist (aka tracker)

From [last
meeting](November_23_2011#Checklist_.28aka_tracker.29.md),
concluded there was not resources at Eclipse Foundation to support
information on Portal, but we'd add section asking for "statement" in
review documentation, as I've written up in the new requirement:
[Documenting
compliance](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements#Release_Review_and_compliance_to_requirements_documentation_.28approximately_RC3.29 "wikilink").
Need to "disconnect" portal dialogs, tracked in .

From last meeting, *Longer term, not in time for Juno, fields such as
link to rampdown plan, link to accessibility testing, link to API
policy, retention policy, etc. will be part of the new "super portal"
for projects to fill in, or not, depending on type of release, needs of
the project, etc.*

### Other business

  - Name that release: Juno+1. Need volunteer to drive community
    discussion and vote.

:\* Need to "launch" this effort first thing in January.

:\* Goal is to have "completely done" by EclipseCon. We have missed this
last two years (at least) since we didn't allow enough time (at least 4
weeks?) for Eclipse Foundation to do their legal vetting of the proposed
(and most popular) name.

  -
    *Chris kindly volunteered to drive the process for the new name
    (again). Thanks Chris\!*

<!-- end list -->

  - Anything else?

## Next Meeting

  - January 4, 2012 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
    Eastern).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *John mentioned Canada's schools (at least, Ottawa's?) are still
    "out" so he won't be able to attend, but we will still plan on 4th,
    unless we decide otherwise on planning list. (And, we can always
    discuss issues on planning list, or have an "extra meeting" in
    January, or anytime, if issues some up outside the monthly cycle.)*
