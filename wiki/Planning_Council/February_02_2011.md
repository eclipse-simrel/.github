## Announcements

  - A change to the Eclipse Software User Agreement is coming (). It is
    recommended that you adopt the new PDE [license feature
    support](http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.com/2011/01/implementing-shared-licenses-with-37m5.html)
    so you can more easily adapt to license changes. You can simply
    refer to the license feature defined by the Eclipse top-level
    project, which will be updated whenever the SUA changes. You should
    wait for  to be resolved before switching.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Helios SR2

2/25/2011 (Fourth Friday of February)

For detailed RC schedules, see [Service Release Schedule in master
plan](Helios_Simultaneous_Release#Service_Releases "wikilink")

  - RC2 is this week ... release is later this month ... any issues?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    '' No issues raised''

## Indigo Status

  - M5 this week ... any issues?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Pascal mentioned a new build of market-place client is needed for
    M5 due to some p2 (internal) changes.*

<!-- end list -->

  - any exceptions to discuss?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *No exceptions were specifically approved at this meeting, but we
    discussed some that will be requested for M6:*
      -
        *Libra. Provisioned. Building (just for day or two). Plans to
        release as incubating subproject of WTP. Kaloyan to prepare
        pages, information about project, and he (and WTP) will come
        back with costs and benefits explanations when requesting the
        exception.*
        *WindowBuilder. Just provisioned. Still CQ work to do. (Wayne
        was optimistic, but ... less certainty that it can get going in
        time).*
        *RAT: Not yet provisioned, nor had creation review. Wayne to
        followup with them.*

<!-- end list -->

  - (ongoing reminder) remember to aggregate project tracking, IP logs,
    docuware, etc., and [update project
    meta-data](Development_Resources/HOWTO/Project_Meta-Data "wikilink")
    as Wayne requested in [cross-project
    note](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg05063.html).

## Indigo Plan and Schedule

  - Should we provide (whole) Orbit Repository as a "runtime target"
    category? Should it be a "trusted repo"? See
    <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=310578#c11>

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''To summarize discussion: It was thought this was not a good time.
    Maybe next release? There was no insurmountable problems known, but
    many questions, that should be discussed widely, and over time, to
    make sure we were not setting a precedent we couldn't support. Such
    as, this is a "change in philosophy" for the common repo. Until now
    it has been oriented towards end-user function, and just last year,
    runtime targets (which is more for committers or extenders) but
    still function/feature oriented. So, do we want to be/provide such a
    general purpose 'common bundle repository'. Should we wait till
    Orbit provides "one repo for all time" repository of bundles, or
    change every release. Currently Orbit itself does not "release" in
    the normal Eclipse sense, the bundles it provides do via being
    included in other projects, but seems if we had a common repo, it
    should have it's own "release review". (In fact, due to history and
    evolution, there are bundles still produced by Orbit that are not
    released in any specific yearly release, as an Eclipse Project does
    not release with it included). Would this lead to Eclipse projects
    not "including" a bundle in their distribution, and just relying on
    the common repo for p2 to find it? And ... would this be a good or
    bad thing? Currently, PC members had not seen many problems or
    difficulties in this area, so some question about "what problem are
    we solving" and while everyone could imagine it'd be a little
    usability improvement, over users having to add the Orbit repo URL
    themselves, didn't seem worth solving right now with so many
    questions. In fact, even lead to one question of is a valid solution
    would be just to provide the URL "pre-populated" with some of the
    standard or common distributions, such as from EPP). While not
    certain, it may be that Orbit can not be part of an operation where
    a user says "install everything" ... that is, some known,
    unavoidable conflicts. While there are certainly fixes or ways
    around this ... it is work someone would have to do. So, did not
    rule out the concept for all time ... but, more work needed. I'll
    update the bugzilla with this summary.

## Other business

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *confirmed/agreed 3-4, 3/20*

<!-- end list -->

  - Name that release. Indigo+1. Need volunteer to drive community
    discussion and vote.

        ''Pascal graciously volunteered to drive this year's "name that

## ToDo Items

  - How is the RoadMap coming along? (Wayne)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Progress, but slow. Wayne still working with individual
        projects that have not provided one (and maybe didn't even know
        they needed one ... so, sounds like some PMC/mentoring guidance
        needed?).*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Wayne would like to "extend" the meaning and use of some fields
        in project meta-data so there projects could summarize their
        release, etc., instead of sending email or making part of
        docuware*. More could be automated then. Overall summaries
        provided, etc. Wayne will (likely) send note to cross-project
        soon with this request.''

<!-- end list -->

  - New [project release tools](http://www.eclipse.org/projects/tools/).
    Some ready. Some near ready? (Wayne)

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        ''Sounds like Wayne's made some excellent tools to ease and
        improve the quality of the process. He'll be posting more notes
        soon (approximately Friday). ''

<!-- end list -->

  - Please encourage your projects to add links to "central" Indigo wiki
    for [New and Noteworthy](Indigo/New_and_Noteworthy "wikilink") and
    [Migration Guides](Indigo/Migration_Guides "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        TODO: Platform needs to have their own central page, like WTP
        does ... or, update this wiki every milestone. It currently
        points to M4 N\&N.

<!-- end list -->

  - TODO (from previous meeting): dw to add/create add a FAQ item around
    "what to handle 3.7 vs. 4.1". Will draw from previous [working
    notes](Indigo/HowToAddress37And41Platform "wikilink").

## Next Meeting

  - [March 2, 12 noon
