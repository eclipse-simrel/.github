## Announcements

  - ?

## Helios SR1

Soon to switch to b3 aggregator format files.

Warm up (RC1) builds to start soon (8/9 to 8/13).

### Maintenance Schedule

SR1 Fourth Friday of September 9/24/2010

SR2 Fourth Friday of February 2/25/2011

For detailed RC schedules, see [Service Release Schedule in master
plan](Helios_Simultaneous_Release#Service_Releases "wikilink")

## Helios Retrospective

Any additions?

[Helios_retrospective](Planning_Council/Helios_retrospective.md)

## Indigo Plan and Schedule

Tracking "setup" required from Foundation in

See initial [Indigo Wiki page](indigo "wikilink")

Are we agreed to
\[<http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/Simultaneous_Release_Plan#Milestones_and_Release_Candidates>|
Indigo dates \]? All shifted by one calendar day (to keep same day of
week). Can we say these are official?

### Issues and Proposal for 3.7 versus 4.1

For planning documents, etc. we'll call 3.7 based work Indigo Minor, and
4.1 based work Indigo Major.

For this plan, more so than previous years, there will need to be
adjustments based on experience over next few months.

Ideally focus would be on 4.1 based work. But final plans need to be
based on where projects want to focus, and what proves suitable.

Main goal: participating projects must work with or contribute to both
platform levels.

There's several options to accomplish this -- and participating projects
must explicitly state what their plans are, what they support.

  - One set of plugins work with both versions.

<!-- end list -->

  - Projects contribute "maintenance only" to Indigo Minor, but branch
    and all new work done assumes Indigo Major

EPP Packages: Ideally, EPP packages would be based on 4.1 (only). If
experience shows 4.1 is not ready, or if projects can not fully move to
4.1, then this needs to be dropped back to 3.7 (only). Is is possible
that each "package owner" can decide which they want. \[Would this make
sense?\] Is is a fair assumption to say its unreasonable to produce two
sets of packages? (I think so, but others can answer too).

Issue: Can all bundles reside in one repo, and correct ones "pulled out"
by P2? (can this be done easily, and reliably, that is).

Issue: If focus is on one stack, how to "test" other stack?

Feedback required from large projects such as webtools, CDT

Issues raised in meeting:

  - Branding. Is it really one simultaneous release? Or two? Is one name
    (Indigo) enough? Does Indigo Major and Indigo Minor suffice? Or, do
    we need a whole additional code name?
  - Provisioning? Often adopters provide an "all in one" product
    package, but they also want to "install into existing installation".
    So, what/how can they "install into". How to document and explain to
    users and customers?
  - Its one thing to conceive of one different "platform" in stack, but
    if or when there are different versions at higher levels, seems to
    get very complicated (e.g. if JDT has an Indigo Major vs. Indigo
    Minor version, that might "force" projects to take different
    planning paths. Its unclear what their plans are, and if the e4
    related function would be "additive" to Indigo Minor bundles, or
    complete replacements.
  - Need another meeting in a few weeks to make progress on this issue.
