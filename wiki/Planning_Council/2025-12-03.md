# 2025-12-03 Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- Java 25 in SimRel, see https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/issues/75
- Follow-up: patching released Eclipse versions
- Working group financial plan 2025

## Minutes

## Release 2025-12
- Overall good shape
- "Eierlegende Wollmilchsau" looks good

## Follow-Up: Patching Released Eclipse Versions
- Sebastian monitored respin of RC2, which is similar to what would need to be done
- Sebastian talked with Hannes: everything should be in place for it
- Question on whether to use this for fixing non-severe regression
  - We should be careful to not pick every regression fix for providing a patch release
  - But we could try out the process with a current regression

## Working Group Financial Plan 2026
- Working group's financial plan 2026 discussed last week at onsite meeting
- Budget decreases and leads to reduction in possible funding of (release) engineering
  - Other areas of investment are also decreased
  - Planning council can do nothing about reduced budget but may have to deal with consequences
- Question raised what to be cut first when budget is reduced
  - Actual release engineering work does not necessarily decrease
  - Only work directly funded by working group as shared effort of companies may decrease
- Planning council will abstain from voting on financial plan due to the higher risk/difficulty it will put on fulfilling goals/duties by reduced budget for (release) engineering

## Java 25 in SimRel
- https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/issues/75
- SimRel requirements allow projects to move to next Java LTS 6-9 months after it release
  - Will be either 2026-03 or 2026-06 for Java 25
- Issue: no Temurin release for Windows on ARM (AArch64) yet
  - TCK not passed
  - Beta builds available that do not pass TCK are available
  - Issue already exists for quite some time also with previous Java releases --> unclear when issue may be resolved
  - We cannot ship a JDK build that does not pass TCK via JustJ/EPP
- Other JDK 25 builds available for Windows on ARM
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/older-releases#openjdk-25
  - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows
- Options
  - Drop support for Windows on ARM (e.g., in SWT and EPP products)
  - Disallow moving to Java 25 for Eclipse 2026-03
    - Eclipse Platform is only allowed to move to new LTS one release after SimRel
	- Java 25 would be most interesting for Platform / SWT (due to FFM)
	- Unclear what to do if situation is the same in 3 months
- Proposal
  - Do not allow SimRel participants to move to Java 25 for the Eclipse 2026-03 release
  - Reevaluate the situation in February/March to see if Windows on ARM support needs to be dropped for 2026-06 or whether Java 25 will not be allowed for 2026-06 as well
  - In case SimRel participants will be allowed to move to Java 25 for the 2026-06 release, the Platform (including SWT) will be as well
  - The proposal will be posted in the according issue https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/issues/75
    - All planning council members are given the chance to veto on this until Tuesday, 9th December 2025
    - In case there is not veto, the planning council (chair) sends the decision to the SimRel mailing list
- Everyone is encouraged to reach out to people involved into Windows on ARM support for Java 25 to clarify if/how/when the issue will be resolved


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on January 7th, 2026.
