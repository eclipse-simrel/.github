## Juno SR2

  - SR2 Recovery Plan

(I've left in the "issues bullet" from last meeting ... to highlight
some of the history here).

### Background

  -

      -

        , , and maybe ?

        [Egit message
        list](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg03039.html)

        Numerous posts to cross-project list

### Alternatives

Please come prepared to discuss alternatives

  -
    Does anyone know of any impact of delays to strategic members that
    might effect choices?
    Impact to the projects you represent on ability to do the re-work if
    needed?

#### Do nothing

  -
    let EGit provide updated project repo with fix
      -
        Pro: easy
        Con: EPP users especially get the bad bug right away ?and could
        damage data? before applying the fix

#### Simply remove EGit 2.3 from common repo

  -
    thus effectively reverting to their 2.1 in SR1, re-spining EPP
    packages, allow to re-mirror, etc.
      -
        Pro: moderately easy -- assuming I could do the p2.remove script
        to remove just their bits (not a certainty)
        Con: EGit starts off pretty far behind

#### Full respin cycle

  -
    Turn on the aggregator, let people update their contributions so it
    runs, hope we get same content, respin EPP, re-test, etc.
      -
        Pro: best quality
        Con: would take 2 weeks (IMHO), sounds like several projects
        would want to contribute new bits, lots of work for all
        participants
          -
            Other bugs mentioned as desired in a respin, if we did one.
            Please comment in these bugs if you have
            questions/suggestions for them.
            GEF  (No "perfect fix", even if we did a respin, due to
            version number snafu even in SR1)
            M2E  (They will effectively be providing an SR2a, it sounds
            like, even if we don't respin)

#### Provide a 4th "composite" to Juno SR2

  -
    Would have only EGit in it. Assuming all was versioned correctly,
    EPP packages and "end-user updates" would find their latest ones
      -
        Pro: moderately easy, with minimal work from other projects.
        Con: The "bad bits" would still be in repo and theoretically
        installable, if someone happened to deliberately pick an older
        version

#### Do a "branched respin"

  -
    In the past, we did a respin once to remove some invalid,
    non-approved third party code (so, "bad bits" *could not* stay, even
    if "not most recent").
    In short, means creating a branch of b3 contribution files, me
    changing everyone's URL to point to the current, specific SR2 site,
    except for those that are allowed to contribute to a respin (which
    would end up pointing to what ever they say is corrected).
      -
        Pro: more assured of getting same bits as before, yet having a
        "clean" SR2 repo (instead of "bad bits" intermingled).
        Con: maybe more work for me (will have to study scripts to find
        where "branch" is specified). Still need to respin EPP, due
        minimal test or "compare" to make sure only what was intended to
        change did in fact change.
        We would still need to decide "who gets to participate".
          -
            I'm most concerned about GEF's versioning problem, since no
            way to fix that after released ... no way to "go down" in
            version numbering ... adopters can "work around" if they
            have a full fledge, new "product", but not if just providing
            new features/plugins or updating an existing product.

#### Summary

  - The most agreed-to item was should not ship as-is.
  - Second most agreed-to item was a full respin was too risky and too
    much time delay.
  - The M2E and GEF bugs are bad (especially the GEF version snafu) but
    felt they were not stop ship bugs, and respin for them not required.
    Though it was recommend GEF move to "3.10" for Kepler, since various
    Juno distributions will end up with a mix of 3.8 and 3.9.
  - GEF's issue was related to having multiple releases in the same
    repo, but specifying only "minimum requirement" in aggregation
    files. Everyone likely needs a refresher on importance (and syntax)
    of making contributions very specific ... and testing early. Just
    because your component is correct, doesn't mean repo or EPP package
    is.
  - The EGit problem was discussed the most; pros and cons to "moving
    up" to 2.3.1 and re-spinning, or revert to SR1 or some point before
    their RC4 update. Pros were lots of fixes improvements have been
    made. Cons were there is still risk in last minute changes to such
    and important piece of Eclipse.
  - Historically, we (PC) started off saying maintenance releases were
    bug fixes only (changes in service field only), but "loosened" the
    rules to accommodate projects that did frequent releases and desired
    to get their latest code to Eclipse users -- a noble and desirable
    goal.
  - PC probably needs to "tighten rules" about minor updates in
    maintenance releases ... say, must be in by RC1, at a minimum.
    Perhaps as much as "released at least one month before RC1" even?
  - EGit probably needs a "refresher course" on the value of the
    Simultaneous Release rules/procedures ... advantages of incremental
    contributions, having a cool-off or ramp-down process. (Mike
    volunteered Wayne to help :)
  - dw will explore easiest way to revert the repo: alternatives are to
    try and use the p2.remove task to remove just EGit/JGit
    features/bundles from the SR2 specific repo (and then EPP process
    would pick up what was in SR1); if that doesn't work the "make an
    aggregate repo from the aggregate repo" should do the trick ... just
    more "search and replace" in a branch of the contribution files, and
    time to literally respin.
  - Once new repo is done, Markus's existing process for spinning EPP
    packages will be ran.
  - Goal was to finish new repo on Monday (or, Tuesday, if complicated).
    EPP packages on Tuesday (or Wednesday). Some extra eyes/sanity
    checks Wednesday (or Thursday). Allow mirrors to repopulate, and
    make "GA" on Friday morning.
  - Ian volunteered use of his ["p2 diff"
    tool](http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2012/10/10/introducing-p2diff/)
    to compare repos.
  - \[After meeting, Matthias Sohn said, in message to cross-project
    list, that "SR2 RC3 contains EGit 2.2.0 \[1\] which was released in
    December and SR1 contains EGit 2.1.0". But, still, RC3 is late to
    change a minor version ... especially now that "trust" is weakened
    ... but assume its a little bit more stable? if "pure removal" works
    I'd prefer that, since easier and more predicable. If not, I'll look
    around and ask others if they feel 2.2 has gotten enough exposure --
    but, that solution requires the "make an aggregate from the
    aggregate" approach ... and still lightly tested by package
    maintainers.\]
  - The trade off on "meeting schedule" vs. "quality release" were
    discussed and I reminded all the importance of our timely releases
    are not so much for us, or even the Eclipse community, but that
    commercial adopters make their product plans based on our dates, so
    any delays introduced by us starts to cost real money to them
    (rescheduling tests, and what ever else) ... but, agreed that
    "software industry" is used to such problems and normally buffers in
    plans can accommodate a one week slip for data-damaging bugs, and a
    one-time slip of maintenance release should not hurt our
    trustworthiness to deliver when we say we will.

## Issues (from previous meeting)

  -
    EGit planning 2.3, but 2.1 is still their common repo contribution?
    (That is, why aren't they "fully participating"?) See . Kepler
    contribution is even further behind.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    **Action Item:** Chris will "get back to us" on what EGit's plans
    are ... he initially thought "final code" would be done in two
    weeks, but I reminded him RC4/final builds are next Wednesday.
