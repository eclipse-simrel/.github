### Next Year's Name

Should we do over?

  -
    evidence of ballot stuffing invalidates what we thought we knew
    we don't literally know extent of the problem, but it is likely to
    be, at least, "in the hundreds"
    cons: delay, toil, and trouble

Concretely, I propose following. Any counter proposals?

  - Do over, start with original list, requiring log in (same as
    bugzilla log in).
  - But do quickly, 1 week for first pass, to 5/12. 1 week for second
    pass, if needed, to 5/19.
  - Please review (and give a test vote at) [sample test
    page](http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/development/test/testpoll.php)
  - Present to community as follows, on original bug, and committers
    mailing list (please review and give comments at meeting. Does it
    have right tone?)

<hr />

Help name the 2011 Eclipse Simultaneous Release -- again\!

As previously stated, the Eclipse Planning Council is trying to come up
with a name for next year's Simultaneous Release and is asking for input
from the Eclipse Community. Accordingly, we collected suggestions for
names, and then set up a quick poll to get some quantifiable data about
preferred names.

But, it has come to our attention that some people voted more than once.
More specifically, many many many times, as if from a script. While our
polling service was known not to be secure, we naively assumed people
would participate in the spirit of a friendly close-knit community.
Unfortunately, we do not know the full extent or pattern of the "ballot
stuffing" since the polling service was not set up to track such detail.
Nor could it, without a unique log in. So, we have enhanced the polling
service to require a log in ... same as bugzilla account ... and would
like to try again to collect some meaningful data about what name the
community prefers. We do care about the community's opinion and felt it
would be a disservice to not re-do the polling in a more accurate way.
The end result might be similar to the polling we just went through ...
or, might reveal a completely different preference, when everyone just
votes once. Since we are already late in the development cycle, we will
allow only one week for voting, to May 12th for the first phase, and
then until May 19th, if a runoff vote is required.

You can read more about it and vote at this URL:
<http://www.eclipse.org/helios/planning/poll2011name.php>

And read the back ground, and pros and cons of the candidate names at
<https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=306864>

Thanks,

<hr />

list](April_07_2010/Proposed_Naming.md) for
voting.

### Any exceptions to note, or discuss?

  -
    ?

### Maintenance Schedule

Fourth Friday of September? 9/24/2010

Fourth Friday of February? 2/25/2011

### Next Year's Schedule

Not ready to discuss details, but the problems with +1, +2, +3 category
(and short times) should be well discussed.

Similarly, Oliver brought up issue with need for better "warm-up"
rhythm, especially if a prereq project is late. (EMF's "last minute" M6
delivery added pressure to TPTP's ability to build/test in time). No
specific actions, process or remedies are known, but ... maybe a
reminder to cross-project list that intermediate or warm-up builds are
good (especially if going to be near deadline).
