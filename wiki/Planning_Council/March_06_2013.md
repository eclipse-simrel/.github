## Juno SR2

  - Any post-release feedback? (Or, too early yet?)

<!-- end list -->

  - Our current policy statement on "new releases" joining a SR
    maintenance release is in our [Policy
    FAQs](SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_FAQ#Policy_FAQs "wikilink").
    Eventually that's the part we'll want to "tighten up". Must balance
    flexibility (agility) with stability. Perhaps something similar to
    "The new release must be in RC1 builds for the SR, must have
    released one month prior to that RC1, and must be willing/able to
    test and provide a quick maintenance release if last minute problems
    found."

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *We didn't want to make a decision at this meeting, since wanted to
    be sure we were considering the "big picture" and not reacting to
    one case, but came up with the following items:*

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Seemed reasonable to everyone that, if we keep our current
        policy, "minor updates must be in fully in by RC1" or else too
        late to join.*
        *Should we even allow minor updates at all? What do adopters
        expect/want from SR releases? Pure maintenance, or new features
        too?*
        *We don't say so, but "no major changes allowed" seems
        reasonable. That is, no API breaking changes. Sometime, "version
        ranges", even minor, in theory could be a "breaking change"
        (though, not exactly API).*
        *Should whether or not in EPP packages be part of one of the
        factors? Seems that's where most stability is
        important/expected, since those users don't have a "choice" to
        move up to a particular version, they get it automatically.*
        *As an aside, even Mylyn no longer does minor updates in SRs ...
        they've stabilized enough not to need it, and recognize they are
        a core piece of several EPP packages, so more important to be
        stable.*

## Kepler

### M6

  - Issues?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *None stated.*

<!-- end list -->

  - Are people "building against" the Platform's Maven/Tycho builds?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *No one said "yes". Should send reminder (near time to put warm up
    in staging).*

## EclipseCon face-to-face

  -
    Sunday, 2 to 4, following by "joint meeting" with Arch. Council,
    from 4 to 5.

<!-- end list -->

  - Agenda topics? (Please list ideas, so we know ahead of time what's
    desired).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Several good ideas were mentioned.*
      -
        *Decide SR Policy.*
        *Should Rt have their own "repo"? Their own Sim Rel Rules? How
        can the value to them be increased?*
        *What relationship is there (should there be) between OSGi/p2
        common repo and Maven/Maven Repos?*

<!-- end list -->

  - Who is planning to attend? (Please fill in with "yes" (Y), "no" (N),
    "indefinite" (I), the later being you haven't decided yet, or
    depends on tight plane schedule being on time, etc.).
