## Topics

  - Galileo [Requirements for
    Participation](Galileo_Simultaneous_Release#Requirements_For_Participation "wikilink")
    - begin to discuss each (keep, toss, amend)
      - Accessibility? New project at Eclipse to aid in development
        guidelines? ACTF?
      - How to verify? Tooling? Checklist updated per milestone? - We
        need to define a process of validating. Use bugzilla? (use
        priority for must/should do, assign milestone, assign to each
        project for each item and track with report?)
      - Make capabilities definition a must-do? Package separately?
      - Add Babel participation as a must-do? Need agreed upon date for
        string freeze for localization.
      - Increase importance of API usage violations? Make a "strong
        recommendation"? Advertise tooling/best practices. Document all
        exceptions with plan for migration off improper usage, including
        bugs submitted to open API where required.
      - Order should do list by priority.
      - Suggest M6 as API freeze for all (documented?)
      - Suggest M7 as the latest performance & scalability testing for
        all projects (currently, the milestone used by platform)
      - Look in RSS feed requirement
      - Splash page icon (\#12)
      - About dialog icons?
      - Combine Encouraged and Could Do into Must/Should do list (or,
        use P1-P4 in bugzilla?)
      - Define what is found in an SDK to provide consistency (finally)?
  - In person meeting to coincide with
    [EclipseWorld](http://www.eclipseworld.net)
  - December 10-11, 2008 - plenary session with Board

## Additional Topics

  - IP process improvement discussion with Janet Campbell - conflict for
    this call, so perhaps the next?

## Action Items

  - Query Babel project for string freeze deadline and participation
    requirement info (Rich)
  - Query ACTF for information on accessibility to include as release
    requirement (Rich)
  - Investigate the use of p2 to create a "virtual" simultaneous release
    update site, sans the jar copying (Rich)
  - Look into having a "name that train" contest to coincide with
    EclipseCon each year (artwork as well?) (Bjorn)
