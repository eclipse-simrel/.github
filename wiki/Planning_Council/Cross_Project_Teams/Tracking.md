## Statement of Problem

Last year, we used bugzilla to track compliance, or not, with the
requirements of a Simultaneous Release. There was a couple of
limitations to that approach that makes us think we can do better.

  - The "summary" of bugs "fixed" or "won't fix" was cumbersome, took a
    long time to run.

<!-- end list -->

  - It seems "old fashioned" to capture tracking information in bugzilla
    (why not make a custom web app, for something we do every year).

<!-- end list -->

  - At best, you could note and summarize "yes/no" type responses. Much
    of "the good stuff" in a simultaneous release process is buried, if
    documented at all. For example, Projects can say, "yes we have a
    documented build process", but why not include/require the URL to
    that documentation.
