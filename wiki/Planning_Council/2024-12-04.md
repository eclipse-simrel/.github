## Actions from Last Meeting

- Agreed on schedule for 2025-03 and 2025-06 releases (see https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/pull/32), added google calendar entries

## Minutes

### Status 2024-12

- Intensive testing by Ed, everything looks good
- Many new platforms in this release
  - Probably some interest for Windows aarch64 (tested by Hannes and Nitin)
  - RISC-V testing was not as extensive as intended
- Release is not added to Eclipse marketplace yet, so marketplace in that product is currently empty
  - Thomas takes action

### Planning 2025-03

- SWT: minimum glibc will be 2.34
  - communication via cross-project already done
- SWT: attempt to make Edge default
  - communication via cross-project pending
  - flag for IE needs to be added
- Java 24: will be released right after Eclipse 2025-03
  - current flag to allow security manager will not be supported anymore (JVM fails to start)
  - Ed takes action to remove flag in Platform
  - discuss further impact in a future meeting
- EPP will remove Xmx flag (was at 2GB)
  - initial memory taken will not be affected
  - maximum memory will increase, more memory might be allocated until GC starts to clean
  - SDK already removed the flag for 2023-12


### Prioritization of Funded Dev Efforts

- WG budget will probably be lower than expected
- Release engineering work can be secured with the budget, but funding of further efforts needs to be reduced
- Prioritization: community mentor work vs. other funded dev efforts
  - community mentors are multipliers, as onboarding of new contributors/committers becomes easier
  - unanimous approval for prioritizing community mentor work over other dev efforts
- High priority issues on [dev efforts board](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/boards/1208) 
  - [JDT Java Text block](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/29)
    - intention of issue was to onboard new JDT committer 
    - unanimous approval of priority reduction
  - [ECF](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/37#note_2855907)
    - would allow to exchange existing HTTP client with JDK-integrated on
    - nice to have, but currently not critical if it is not done
  - [GTK 4](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse-wg/ide-wg/ide-wg-dev-funded-efforts/ide-wg-dev-funded-program-planning-council-top-issues/-/issues/38)
    - has high priority for many members/companies
    - unclear whether we can cover all the issue with given budget
    - companies depending on Linux/GTK need to jump in
    - additional issue: reviewing
      - work currently mostly done by Alexander, but has less time to do it
      - other committers also need to review/merge, even if they are no highly experienced SWT/GTK developers --> better than not doing any progress
      - proposal: more focus in testing that reviewing, can also be done by non-committers
        - a "how to test" section should be provided in according PRs
        - testing on Windows via WSL is not sufficient, but might be better than nothing
        - proper labels for those PRs indicating that tests are wanted (and may also be done by rather unexperienced contributors) could be useful

## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on January 8th, 2025 (changed from January 1st according to default scheduling).
