# 2025-11-05 Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- OCX attendance
- Patching released Eclipse versions


## Minutes

### Status SimRel / 2025-12
- Overall good shape, some uncertainty regarding JUnit 6 support
- Ed worked on SBOMs
  - Can check for CVEs in SimRel contents
  - Found CVEs that were resolved by updating Orbit or consumers

### OCX Attendance
- For some it depends on acceptance of talk proposal --> maybe ask again after decisions
- Mélanie and Ed will attend anyway
- Manoj, Mathias, Federico, Heiko have submitted or plan to submit

### Patching Released Eclipse Version
- Trigger: broken selection highlighting with MacOS 26.1 https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/2621
  - Major issue when using any released Eclipse version on MacOS 26.1
  - Will only be resolved with next Eclipse release or by using I-Builds
  - Demands for allowing to patch released Eclipse versions
- Motivation: not having to wait until next release, i.e., up to three month, when severe issues arise such as:
  - CVEs, in particular in core frameworks like Equinox
  - Compatibility breaks, such as new OS versions require changes in Eclipse (such as with the current MacOS issue)
  - Bugfixes, for unnoticed bugs with high impact that came into a release
- Technical aspects of preparing / building patches
  - We already have maintenance branches, from which we can respin
  - They are disabled right after the release because of limited infrastructure capabilities
  - Would need to be on-demand builds
- Technical aspects of / options for shipping
  - Possible via an update site
    - https://download.eclipse.org/releases is an automatically created composite with a strict structure ->  we may not want to modify manually
    - For the platform/SDK there is already: https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/
    - Update site like the ones above are already added to EPP products for the projects included in the package
    - One difficulty might be to produce an update site with minimal changes, only containing the modified artifacts
  - Use notifications and mechanisms like for supported Java versions after Eclipse releases
    - Uses a permanent marketplace entry
    - Creates a minimal, incremental update site
  - Can be realized via a feature patch
  - It might be difficult if natives (like Equinox launcher) are involved -> may need to be excluded?
- Quality assurance of maintenance branches and derived patches
  - Maintenance branches may already contain other changes that have been backported
  - We need a process for when/what to backport to avoid untended
  - Proposal: provide patches for current, "stable" release
    - Limit backports for current release as much as possible
    - Require PMC+1 for backport changes to current release (or some other way of "police" for limiting number of backports/patches to the absolutely necessary)
  - Proposal: ship patches (only) for current, "stable" release
- Comparison to LTS approaches
  - Old LTS program from Eclipse Foundation: https://lts.eclipse.org/
    - Was about fixing older releases even as an external company (not IBM)
    - There was extra infrastructure to provide according infrastructure
  - We should focus on having a stable release (i.e, patch current release if necessary) instead of LTS
- Effort / costs
  - Lacking budget / capacities for keeping the maintenance branch builds working
  - Maybe we could use funded dev efforts contracts to support that work, given the demand and benefit of providing patches
- Actions
  - Heiko takes the topic to the IDE WG to discuss relevance and potential funding
  - Sebastian tries to investigate what / how much needs to be done to support the discuss process


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on December 3th, 2025.
