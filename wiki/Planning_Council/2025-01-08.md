## Minutes


### Sponsorship / Donation
- Context: presentation of sponsorship options to IDE users shall be improved
- Proposal: Eclipse plug-in with a "donate" view showing up at IDE startup in any of the view stacks
- Inspired by Thunderbird
- Wayne has a prototype view based on pure SWT: https://github.com/waynebeaton/org.eclipse.sponsor
  - Initial version used browser but dropped for potentially high footprint, delaying startup
  - Current state it rudimentary, needs to be polished (and expertise is required to do so)
  - Consensus: a solution that dynamically retrieves content should be preferred, as static content might get old/outdated
    - E.g., based on a browser loading some HTML from the web
	- "Welcome" view also uses browser, so if using a browser on startup should really have an impact, it might occur there as well
	- Technical integration based on a browser just opening a URL would be easy; effort needs to be spent on providing a proper website
	- View could also open up (soon) after startup to avoid an delaying effects on the overall startup
  - Alternatives
	- Using editor instead of a view (which is just considered a document closed like any other file, comparable to "news" documents opening after updates in other tools)
	- Other tools have a toolbar item to donate (which has the benefit of always being present); we currently only have a menu entry
	- Maybe multiple solutions should be implemented and analyzed regarding which gives best results
	- Might be configured to not be shown again, but we should not address that people want to get rid of such a popup as soon as possible
- Ability to collect information on how the donation page was reached (from website, from IDE etc.)? --> is already in place
- There are different technical options how to present donation options that can be realized easily; actual question is what and how we want to present to the user
- Why do people want to donate?
  - In Thunderbird, most people have same/similar workflows, so every user will benefit from every (or most) improvements
  - In Eclipse, there are many areas that many people do not directly benefit from, so if they do not know where a donation goes to, they will not find their donation invested in a way that helps them
  - Maybe it should be clear (and true) that donations go to the development of the essential base that everyone benefits from


### Steering Committee On-Site February 11th/12th
- In case there are topics that should be discussed by the steering committee, submitting them soon (before the on-site meeting) would be good, as there will be quite some time to discuss several topics at that meeting

### Status 2025-03
- Marketing for CDT Release in March?
  - To be discussed directly between Jonah and Thomas
- Impact of Java 24
  - Platform cleaned up of SecurityManager issues
  - Good state, upcoming release will be working when run with Java 24

Next meeting will be on February 5th, 2025.
