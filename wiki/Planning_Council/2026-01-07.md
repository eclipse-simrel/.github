# 2026-01-07 Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- State of Embedded CDT project


## Minutes

### Embedded CDT

- https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/
- Belongs to IoT TLP: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt
- Contributes to SimRel and is packages in dedicated "Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers" EPP package: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2025-12/r/eclipse-ide-embedded-cc-developers
- Lacks maintenance
  - Problematic dependencies
    - Hard-coded dependencies
    - Outdated dependencies as wide range of Eclipse Platform versions should be supported
  - No maintainer (with time) available
  - EPP package is non-functional
- It might be necessary to drop from SimRel and remove EPP product in the current release cycle
- A general alternative for the many EPP products we have could be to favor default products and provide extensions via marketplace
  - Does not solve the issue of the unmaintained plug-ins here


## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on February 4th, 2026.
