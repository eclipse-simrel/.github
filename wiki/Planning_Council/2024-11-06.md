# 2024-11-06 Meeting Notes

## Minutes

### Planning Council Chair
- Heiko steps up as candidate
- unanimously elected

### Schedules for Next Releases
- Perception: December release date is always earlier
  - 2 years ago December release was moved forward one week
  - all releases move forward one or two days per year
  - shift  one week later at some point in time to compensate?
    - maybe next year for December release (since December release development phase is one week shorter anyway)
    - not for March release since then Eclipse would be released _after_ Java xx without providing Java xxz support (essentially the P build of Java support cannot be on the March Eclipse at the time of Java Support release since Eclipse would not be officially released)
    - can be thought of June release as well since there is no dependency on Java 
- Consider Java releases for schedule?
  - we could make our releases later to avoid patch releases for new Java version
  - challenge: very limited time to come up with Java release and features frozen late in Java development cycle &rarr; patch policy relieves us from pressure to deliver Java version support for Eclipse release (reduces risk)
- Independence of Java compiler and runtime support
  - Some of the Java runtime support, constants will be available only with the "complete" Java Support after the official Java release - this makes it difficult for the softwares that consume some of these changes early to adapt to the latet Java releases.
  - one could separate Java runtime support (to be shipped with Eclipse release) from compiler support (to be shipped as patch) &rarr; make runtime support available early, e.g., for PDE
  - we should try to approach changes in these policies in 2025
- TODOs
  - propose schedule for 2025-03 and 2025-06 releases
  - discuss possible change in release policy (Java version support) for 2025-09 release (JDK 24) in March 2025

### Status of 2024-12
- "decent shape, instabilities in Platform are past us"
- more changes in EPP packages than before, e.g. new platforms (RISC-V, Windows on ARM), Java root store
  - specific to EPP (SDK developers won't notice)
  - SDK tests are experimentally being run with Windows on ARM
  - Windows on ARM will become more important in next years
  - EPP package owners test their packages, but usually only with platform of their choice; tests with Windows on ARM will, e.g., be performed by Nitin

## Next Meeting

A reminder that the next meeting is scheduled for December 4th, 2024.
