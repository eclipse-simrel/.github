## Announcements

  - ?

## Helios SR1

  - Any issues? complaints?

<!-- end list -->

  - One issue to document as feedback (that I have heard about from TPTP
    PMC/Planning Council Rep): EMF didn't deliver any maintenance until
    the day after RC4 +1 day \[but, unclear to me is if that was just
    download zips or any form of delivered fixes, even in helios repo?\]
    I think, it deserves repeating that communication is key. We all
    need to make an effort to keep others informed. The late (or last
    minute?) changes caused TPTP to have to do a lot of re-work and was
    made worse by there being no notice or announcement on cross-project
    list. I'm sure there's many things that could have been different,
    from all teams involved ... but just documenting this case as once
    example of the importance of keeping others informed. Not to
    mention, of course, that incremental delivery of fixes allows for
    better testing. I also suggested the TPTP team communicate more
    directly with EMF team either through their mailing list or
    cross-project list, to let them know when impacted, but I think in
    this case, by the time it was discovered there wasn't much to do.
    Anything we, as Planning Council, can do to help situations like
    this? Foster timely communication?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Ed said they will communicate better in future.*

<!-- end list -->

  - The build machine failure and slow recovery was nearly enough to
    derail the scheduled release. Not sure what more we can do, but glad
    to hear IT team will provide more support for build machine recovery
    (See ).

<!-- end list -->

  - The mirrors were a bit overloaded with our "outflow" the day or two
    before, and had trouble "catching up".

<!-- end list -->

  -
    There is no longer any need to wait until "day before" for projects
    to put their artifacts in their final location, as long as leave
    "invisible" until the official release. Everyone waiting until the
    day before means the mirrors are very busy pulling content the day
    before, and have trouble getting caught up and in a steady state
    before the actual release. So, one action is to make sure everyone
    is properly educated about his. It might take some thing more formal
    ... some projects promote 5 days before, some 4 days before, some 3
    days before, etc. Also, may need better directions on how to promote
    but leave invisible ... perhaps many projects wait and promote at
    last minute because they don't know how to do that?''

### Maintenance Schedule

SR2 Fourth Friday of February 2/25/2011

For detailed RC schedules, see [Service Release Schedule in master
plan](Helios_Simultaneous_Release#Service_Releases "wikilink")

## Helios Retrospective

Any additions? *No additions. Move to reference section.*

[Helios_retrospective](Planning_Council/Helios_retrospective.md)

## Indigo Status

  - M2 repo successfully created *\[discovered after meeting I forgot to
    promote\! Done now\]*

<!-- end list -->

  - No M2 EPP packages

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        And I've pestered Markus enough he's stopped returning my
        emails? :(

<!-- end list -->

  - 3 projects not in M2:

<!-- end list -->

  -
    jetty
    riena
    subversive

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Do they really intend to drop out? Or does this violate "once in
    always in"?

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        *Tom with discuss with jetty and riena, Wayne and/or Chris to
        discuss with subversive*

## Indigo Plan and Schedule

[Indigo
Requirements](http://www.eclipse.org/indigo/planning/EclipseSimultaneousRelease.php)

Suggestions during meeting:

  - Make explicit that to be in repo, feature includes must be strict,
    so installs or builds are reproducible. (Even if there might
    eventually be improvements that allow additional features, with
    loose constraints ... but "minimum" requirement is the strict
    inclusion. Unclear what loose requirement solution will be. Note:
    the strict requirements are the way things are currently done ...
    just best to make explicit, since it has come up before.

<!-- end list -->

  - Move capabilities to "good citizen" section (and check wording to
    make clear that to document "not supported" is one option ... or,
    possibly "we don't know what this means" :).

<!-- end list -->

  - Consistent license. No real change to requirement, but should
    provide pointers to bugs where standard "user agreement" may change
    (to include EDL) and where p2 may be improved to allow pointer to
    URI ... or something.

<!-- end list -->

  - Add a "must do" to be in EPP package, must run on/test on Eclipse
    3.7.

<!-- end list -->

  - Add a "should do" to have a 4.1 theme item in plan to describe what
    project is doing for 4.1 (and give some examples).

Tracking "setup" required from Foundation in

See initial [Indigo Wiki page](indigo "wikilink")

Review: There is a subtle implication of specifying Java 6 as "minimum
runtime" requirement. Currently, we require contributors to use Java 5
when using pack200, since if not, and if involves a jar that contains no
Java (e.g. source or documentation) then it can not be unpacked with
Java 5, Java 6 would be required. This has been a headache for people
since for many it means tweaking build scripts so an "old" (1.5) VM is
used for that one step. During aggregation, we purposely use Java 5 to
catch errors in this regard. For Indigo, I propose we not worry about
being consistent here, and just use Java 6 during aggregation. Some
projects may still want to use 1.5 VMs to do their pack200 ... if their
adopters want it ... but I see no reason for mass consistency here ...
if Java 6 is assumed to be minimum runtime VM. Any issues? Dissent?

  -
    *Some concern expressed, but mostly a matter of letting people know
    and documenting options. For example, for projects that **want**
    compatibility with VMs less than 1.6, they still can, of course, but
    will no longer get "built in" test from aggregation. Plus, should
    make clear, even a VM less than 1.6 can still use a pack200 (or, an
    unpack200 executable) from another VM, such as a 1.6 distribution,
    and [specify it on their command
    line](Pack200#Pack200_Executable_location "wikilink") using
    `-Dorg.eclipse.update.jarprocessor.pack200`.*

### Issues and Proposal for 3.7 versus 4.1

  - See working notes in
    <http://wiki.eclipse.org/Indigo/HowToAddress37And41Platform>

## Other business

  - ''We were reminded Mylyn is Top Level project now, and we should be
    sure to invite rep to Planning Council. ''

<!-- end list -->

  - *John mentioned Platform may drop Motif support from swt ...
    decision not final yet, and not sure if it effects any adapters or
    members ... just giving a heads up*

## ToDo Items

  - *Note from Wayne, to Wayne: (actually from last meeting) Remember to
    review plans starting after M4 (at latest) so questions can be
    clarified before "road map" produced.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *Wayne teased us all with promise of new tools to check CQs against
    downloads, which we projects can use ourselves ... but he wasn't
    ready to tell us about them today and he'll be saying more over next
    few days or weeks.*

<!-- end list -->

  - *dw to sort out tracking path.*
