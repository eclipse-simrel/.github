## Announcements

  - Any?

## Indigo SR2

  - Reminder: Indigo "warmup" RC1 January 13 to January 20th. Remember
    it is called "warmup" since we do not expect it to be a true
    "release candidate", important fixes will be not necessarily be in
    it, and they will be added in subsequent RCs, we don't expect
    adopters to invest much in final acceptance testing with RC1, and
    its purpose it to mostly make sure we can all still build the Indigo
    stream, get in sync with each other, etc. Subsequent RCs (2, 3)
    should be planned to be true release candidates (ideally final
    builds, for many projects) with the absolute final build being RC4:
    final aggregation build 2/15, for release on 2/24.

## Juno

### Issues or Exceptions

  - Any issues? Everyone in? Any exceptions known?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Exceptions for projects not in M4, that still will to join Juno:
      -
        Virgo *(3 +1 approve votes during meeting, Doug, Kaloyan, Kim)*
        ''Some from Modeling ... It was thought EMF Query 2 would be
        "replacing" EMF Query, perhaps one from GMF Tooling? ''
          -
            *TODO: DW to send follow-up note to Ed asking him to clarify
            exceptions and send note to planning council list, since Ed
            was not at meeting.*

### Plans

  - Yearly reminder to Wayne: allow some time in January to consolidate
    plans for "Road-map" to make sure you have what you need for March
    board meeting.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Wayne reminded us there is no "road map" for board approval any
    longer (due to by-law and dev. process changes), but the plans will
    still be "rolled up" and be part of the "report to the Board". Wayne
    will look into "pulling out" the "3.8 support" information for
    summary, if that's feasible and make sure planning council can
    see/review rolled up plans.*

### Juno+1 Name

  - Name that release: Juno+1. We should review the "candidate" list
    before voting, being sure to remove any that we know we could not
    live with, so people do not feel they "waste" a vote on a name that
    would never be accepted. (Though, we do reserve the right to remove
    any, at any time, if new information comes to light, such as a word
    has an inappropriate meaning in another language, etc.). \[.\]

#### Release History

  - 2006 Callisto
  - 2007 Europa
  - 2008 Ganymede
  - 2009 Galileo
  - 2010 Helios
  - 2011 Indigo
  - 2012 Juno

#### Potential Names

  - Kepler
  - Koala
  - Kirk
  - Kuiper
  - Krakatoa
  - Kosmos
  - Kelvin
  - Kinetic
  - Krypton
  - Knuth
  - Kapteyn
  - Kahn
  - Kratos
  - Kronos
  - Kore
  - Klio
  - Koronis
  - Kari
  - Kale
  - Ketu

#### Voting Names

  - Kronos (probably an issue due to existing companies and trademarks,
    can lead to confusion)
  - Koronis: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koronis_family>
  - Kari: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_(moon)>
  - Kale: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale_(moon)>
  - Kartos: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(mythology)>
  - Kuiper: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt>
  - Kepler: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler>
  - Ketu: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketu_(mythology)>

*During meeting, "kale" was removed, due to similarity with vegetable
name, and "Kronos" was removed, agreeing its been used before for
software/OS names. "kepler" was questioned because it was once the name
of an Eclipse project, now archived, but it is believed it never did
much (existed for only a year and a half, and never had an official
release) so Wayne will investigate some to confirm that, but it probably
would not be ruled out. That would leave 6 names to vote-on. Chris will
work with Wayne and webmasters to setup "Eclipse voting poll" (similar
to previous years, where you can vote just once, and have to have at
least a bugzilla account to vote). Thanks Chris\!*

### Other Business

  - Anything else?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *We briefly discussed "priorities" of projects, such as for IP
    Review, and in case of the (remote) possibility that the build
    machine would have to be rationed, etc. As one aspect of this, we
    will keep the "offset" field in tracker and ask projects to fill
    that it (many have already) and Wayne agreed to "link in" that
    information better in the "list of participating projects" (or
    similar). Thanks Wayne\!*

  - February 1, 2012 (our regular "first Wednesday" meeting, at Noon
