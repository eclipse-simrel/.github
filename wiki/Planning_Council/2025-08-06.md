# 2025-08-06 Meeting Notes

## Agenda

- Status 2025-09
  - WTP contribution missing
  - Multiple terminal implementations
- General Status
  - PDT and ECF stalled

## Status

### 2025-09
- Overall everything in good shape
- WTP: No contribution to 2025-09 yet
  - Requires `com.sun.el.javax.el` which Platform stopped to use: https://github.com/eclipse-servertools/servertools/issues/15
    - Orbit repository was added to WTP contribution to consume that dependency
    - In the long term, having Orbit in that contribution is not good because projects may start relying on things being provided by Orbit
    - WTP was not responsive on that topic yet
  - JavaScript in WTP: has some ECMAScript-3-equivalent implementation (we now have 7); probably only kept for modifying JSP files
- Multiple Terminal implementations
  - Terminal moved from CDT to Platform
  - Christoph is working on making the Platform implementation being used everywhere
  - For the upcoming release we will have two Terminals available
  - Terminal lives on top of CDTs native launcher: many things not handled properly on Windows without
  - Remaining consumers of CDT terminal, e.g.:
    - PDT
    - TCF
      - But no consumers in SimRel
      - Just many CDT users consume it

### General
- PDT is stalled
  - Last commit more than 1 year ago: https://github.com/eclipse-pdt/pdt/commits/master/
  - Old version of Lucene: SimRel projects are migrating to Lucene 10 (https://github.com/eclipse-dltk/dltk.core/issues/5)
  - No urgent need for actions on our side
- ECF is stalled
  - No Maven deployment possible anymore prohibiting progress, see https://github.com/eclipse-ecf/ecf/pull/223#issuecomment-3156277423
  - Example for PR not being looked at: https://github.com/eclipse-ecf/ecf/pull/224
  - Platform no longer uses ECF features
  - Maybe some bundles (regarding filetransfer) could be moved/copied to p2, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567659#c3
    - We could change bundle names if necessary but that may lead to incompatibliities
	- Proxy support for company environments would be included in those bundles, so will still work
  - Maybe other SimRel projects have further dependencies to other parts of ECF that they have to deal with
  - Need to find a solution in the next release cycle
    - Thomas will reach out to Wayne and Scott
	- Potentially contanct PMC, which is RT

## Action Items

- Discuss ECF again in next meeting with feedback from Thomas

## Next Meeting

Next meeting will be on September 3rd, 2025.
