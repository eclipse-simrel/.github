## Notes

### 2021-12 release status

  - Discussed PDT + PHP EPP broken issue - see conversations
    <https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse.org-planning-council/msg03514.html>
    and
    <https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse.org-planning-council/msg03523.html>
      - Jonah will work with PDT team (specifically Dawid Pakula) to try
        to get respin PDT in for 2021-12
      - If PDT team can't resolve issue in time, Jonah (via Tools PMC)
        will request to join PDT as a committer so that a respin can be
        done
      - We may need to slip the EPP build date to have time to get this
        in. No consideration for slipping the release date yet.

### PGP Signing

  - Platform team plan to have test dependencies in PGP only form from
    Maven directly instead of Orbit. This will allow testing install
    flow for PGP signed jars.
  - IDE WG minutes were shared with Planning Council - see
    <https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse-ide-wg/msg00114.html>
  - Wayne has volunteered to try and put together the document that is
    digestible by the IDE WG and reviewers. The source material is
    "Implemented PGP and p2 strategy as alternative to jarsigner" as
    initially assembled by Mickael Istria is
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dl10ia092X5hN1qfKoHYvriCNM-iBqiOkfjnntxaBbk/edit>
