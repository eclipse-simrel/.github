## Announcements

  - \- Naming Mars+1 (2016 Eclipse Simultaneous Release)

      - 'Neptune' and 'Nova' and 'Neo' are dead in the water due to
        trademarks; Took a new poll of remaining "N-words".

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Decision was made to "start over", on accelerated cycle, expanding
    "letters" to "O and P" in addition to "N", and then having voting at
    "EclipseCon".*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    ''We would try to "vet" the names a little better ourselves ... at
    least a web-search to see if the name of any other "software
    product".

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Will also including asking community about using "numbers". Seemed
    the consensus of Planning Council was to use "Year" such as "16" for
    "2016 June Release" (as a "backup plan") but wasn't that clear on
    what to do with "Service Releases" ... especially since they are not
    strictly "Service Releases" as they used to be. One alternative was
    to use "year and month", such as 16.6, 16.9, but that would make the
    second "service release" be 17.2 (which, sounds confusing, since
    sounded like a "major release") so, presumably, if we go the
    "numbered route", we'd stick with "16" (for 16.0) and then 16.1,
    16.2, etc.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *The notion of using "years of Eclipse" or "years of Simultaneous
    Release" (especially the former) was thought to be confusing since
    could be confused with "year", such as 2016 will be release "15" of
    Eclipse (which started in 2001).*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *There was concern expressed (by me :) for full disclosure) about
    continuing 'the naming process' as we do, since by definition it
    gravitates towards "popular names" which are the ones most likely to
    lead to "legal issues". (So, IMHO, we need to be prepared to change
    the process? Or, use a numbering system?)*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Was also suggested to get more guidance from "lawyers", but in the
    end, does not seem they could give that much guidance, at least in
    an economical way.*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *An interesting observation was made that going "the numbered route"
    sounded more "product-like" than the clever "code names" which
    sounds more "open source community like" ... but, admittedly, that's
    not necessarily a bad thing.*

  - EclipseCon Breakfast: Please RSVP to Wayne. (See his [message on
    Planning Council

    you'd like.

## Luna SR2

  - Congratulations\!

## Mars Planning

  - Any issues?
  - Improving categories in Simultaneous Release repo? See
    [SimRel/Feature Categories](SimRel/Feature_Categories "wikilink") --
    Wayne? Have a proposal yet?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Wayne reports that focus will likely change on an improved
    presentation of "Eclipse Projects" in the "Market Place Client".*

<!-- end list -->

  - Moving "Sim Release Aggregation" to "HIPP Instance". (I hope in time
    for M6) (dw)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    \- Besides being "HIPP" jobs will be restructured to have a
    "validation-only job", a "build with cache" job, and (still) a
    "clean build") job.

## Progress on Action Items

  - Improve "aggregator examples/doc". (dw -- in progress).

## New Business

    competition"](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/greatfix/) and asked
    for help "spreading the word".
