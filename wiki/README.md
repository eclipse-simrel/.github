# Eclipse IDE Simultaneous Release (SimRel)

The [Eclipse Foundation](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Foundation) and its community of projects and contributors produce releases on a coordinated schedule that are often referred to as *simultaneous release*, *coordinated release* or *release train* of Eclipse.

This folder provides the "wiki" for the Eclipse SimRel and Eclipse Planning Council.
The main pages on this wiki are:

- [Eclipse Simultaneous Release](Simultaneous_Release.md)
- [Eclipse Planning Council](Planning_Council.md)

Pull requests are welcome for these pages.

#### Why this format?

You may be wondering why this format for the pages?
The information in this folder used to be stored at [wiki.eclipse.org](https://wiki.eclipse.org/), but in early 2024 that wiki [will be made read-only](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/wikis/Wiki-shutdown-plan).
The GitHub built-in wiki was determined to be insufficient (non-committers can't easily contribute - no PRs, folder nesting is not fully supported and overall navigation is somewhat limited), therefore simply storing the files as markdown directly in this repository seemed the best solution.
Contributions that turn these markdown files into HTML, using technology like Jekyll and GitHub pages would be very welcome.
