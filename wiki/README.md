# SimRel Wiki

A number of Eclipse projects harmonize their development activities to produce releases on a coordinated schedule 
to produce the so-called *simultaneous release*, *coordinated release*, or *release train* of Eclipse.

#### Why this format?

You may be wondering why this format for the wiki pages?
The information in this folder was previously hosted at [wiki.eclipse.org](https://wiki.eclipse.org/),
but in early 2024 that wiki [was made read-only](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/wikis/Wiki-shutdown-plan).
The GitHub built-in wiki was determined to be insufficiently flexible.
- Non-committers can't easily contribute due to lack of support for Pull Requests.
- Folder nesting is not fully supported.
- Overall navigation is somewhat limited.

Therefore simply storing the files as markdown directly in this repository seemed the best solution.
