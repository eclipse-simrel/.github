> purpose of the IP Log review is to confirm that the project team
> understands the Eclipse IP Policy and is implementing the supporting
> processes. *An IP Log is not intended to reflect the intellectual
> property included with any particular release.* Project teams can
> continue to make changes to project code after submitting their IP Log
> for review.
