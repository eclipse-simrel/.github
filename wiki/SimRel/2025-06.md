This document relates to 2025-06, the Eclipse Foundation's multi-project [Simultaneous Release](../Simultaneous_Release.md) of June 2025.

## Delayed M2
**Note:** Due to ongoing issues with the Eclipse Foundation infrastructure affecting or even preventing builds for projects contributing to SimRel (particularly including Eclipse Platform), we have delayed M2 by one week. The subsequent dates for M3 and RCs stay the same. We continuously monitor the status of Eclipse Foundation infrastructure and reevaluate further impact on the release schedule.

## Common information

- [Simultaneous Release Requirements](Simultaneous_Release_Requirements.md) (aka must-dos)
- [Simultaneous Release Plan](Simultaneous_Release_Plan.md) Information that stays the same for each release, like requirements for participation, communication channels, etc.
